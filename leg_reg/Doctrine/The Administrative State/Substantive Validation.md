# Substantive Validation

To determine what it is an agency has issued, see [[Procedural Validation]].

## Validation of an interpretive rule
A court may find the agency's interpretive rule to be *valid* or to be *unsound*.

#### Mead Framework
Applying [[Mead]], the agency’s interpretation should be scrutinized under the framework set forth in [[Chevron]] or [[Skidmore]].
 1. The first question is whether Congress delegated to the agency the authority to make rules carrying the force of law, see [[Mead]].
	 * ==Answer whether Congress did== (possibilities include [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]] authorization, permission to “regulate,” formal adjudicatory hearings, or comparably formal requirements). Delegation of quasi-judicial or quasi-executive power do not count.
	1.   IF CONGRESS DID → The second question under Mead is whether the agency exercised that authority when promulgating this interpretation. 
			  *   ==Answer whether the agency did==
			1.   IF THE AGENCY DID → Because the agency, to issue this interpretation, used the legislative authority delegated to it by Congress, apply the [[#Chevron Framework]] (below)
			2.   IF THE AGENCY DIDN’T → Because the agency issued its interpretation without using the legislative authority delegated to it by Congress, Skidmore applies, and the agency’s interpretation is owed judicial deference according to its “power to persuade,” [[Mead]] (quoting [[Skidmore]]).
	2.    IF CONGRESS DIDN’T → Because Congress did not delegate legislative authority to this agency, Mead's second question is moot, and the [[#Skidmore Framework]] applies. Consider also were Congress to have delegated that authority, whether the agency used delegated authority here.
	
#### Chevron Framework
	
** The agency’s interpretation either is or is not valid under the Chevron framework. This framwork is only applied to rules that are deemed to be [[Procedural Validation|procedurally valid]]**.

1. ==STEP ONE of the Cheveron Test is to ask whether Congress has spoken to this legal question== such that no gap is left for the agency to fill with its own interpretation.  Address whether the agency has given a reason for its interpretation and whether Congress has explicitly disapproved of this interpretation. Turn to tools of [[#Statutory Interpretation]] to check whether Congress's intent was clear.
	 *  **NOTE**: For [[#^563656|major questions]], Congress's silence is an implicit exclusion. It would have had to speak to a given issue to communicate its intent to include it.
	 
	1.    IF THERE’S A GAP → Thus, Congress has not spoken to this legal question. Turning to Step Two, the question is whether the agency’s interpretation is reasonable in light of the statute’s text and purpose, see [[Babbitt]].
	1.    IF THERE’S NO GAP → Thus, Congress has spoken to this legal question. But assuming that Congress had not done so, we would turn to Step Two […^go to “if there’s a gap” path].
5.   ==STEP TWO of the Chevron Test is to ask whether the agency's interpretation is "a permissible construction of the statute" that is "reasonable".==
	 * **NOTE**: The Supreme Court is the only court that has ever felt so empowered as to answer "no" here.
    
	
#### Skidmore Framework
** The agency’s interpretation either is or is not persuasive under Skidmore.**
 
Under this framework, agencies are afforded *Skidmore respect*. The persuasiveness of an interpretation is evaluated in the context of the totality of the following criteria:
1. The agency used adequate care in reaching this interpretation.
2. The agency arrived at this interpretation through formal process(es).
3. The agency has demonstrated this interpretation consistently over time.
4. The agency's reasoning is persuasive.
5. The agency has special expertise on this question.

* IF PERSUASIVE UNDER SKIDMORE → The agency’s decision is, on balance, persuasive under Skidmore and warrants respect as a valid interpretation of the law. 
* IF NOT PERSUASIVE UNDER SKIDMORE → The agency’s decision is, on balance, unpersuasive under Skidmore, and should be reviewed [[Statutory Interpretation|de novo]].

IN EITHER CASE → Consider if the agency had been delegated legislative authority or used such authority such that this action was subject to [[#Chevron Framework|Chevron deference]].


#### Statutory Interpretation
-   Text
-   Purpose
-   Legislative History
	-   See [[Chevron]], as a reminder that agencies can change their interpretations over time.
-   Constitutional Avoidance
	-   See [[DeBartolo]]. Aside from the Chevron and Skidmore analyses, constitutional avoidance also works in favor of setting aside the agency's interpretation when the interpretation raises serious Constitutional issues. Such an interpretation may only be deferred to (and thus give rise to Constitutional questions for the court to take up) if Congress made a clear statement allowing for it.
- Major Question Cannon
	*	See [[FDA v. Brown & Williamson]]. Aside from the Chevron and Skidmore analyses, this canon compels setting aside the agency's interpretation when the question posed by the statute involves significant political and economic impacts. Major questions must only be answered by agency interpretations **when Congress has given a clear statement giving the agency such jurisdiction**. Deference under the Chevron framework is premised on Congress’ implicit delegations of authority to agencies, but significant issues like this require explicit delegations. ^563656

## Validation of an agency policy decision
 
 A court may find the agency's policy decision to be *valid* or to be *unsound*.
    
-   Because the [statute] [does/does not] specify a standard of review, courts will review it under [that standard/the APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious review process]. State Farm (determining that the NTMVSA did not provide its own standard of review but stipulated the APA’s review provisions controlled). Under A&C review, agency actions are presumed to be valid, but courts must not rubberstamp them. Instead, courts must inspect the agency’s cumulative evidence to determine if the agency had a rational basis in the record for its decision.
    

### Arbitrary and Capricious Review

The arbitrary and apricious standard of review was put forth in [[State Farm]].
-   The agency must provide a record that is whole, [[5 U.S.C. § 706]], and also adequate for judicial review, [[Nova Scotia Foods]].
-   Analyze whether the agency's decision is arbitrary and capricious under the [[#State Farm Factors]].
-   A&C → The agency’s policy decision is arbitrary and capricious and is void under [[5 U.S.C. § 706]].
-   NOT A&C → The agency’s policy decision is well-reasoned and supported by the record, and it may stand as such.

#### State Farm Factors
1. First, the [agency] [did/did not] fail to consider an important aspect of the problem (e.g., material comments, obvious alternatives).
    

-   Consideration must not be boilerplate but must be reasoned, pointing to particulars and relying on expertise.
    

2. Second, the [agency] must not have relied on factors Congress didn’t intend for it to consider.
    
3. Third, the agency’s explanation for its decision must not be contrary to the evidence. State Farm (NHTSA acted irrationally by concluding detachable belts would not be worth requiring).
    
4.  Fourth and finally, the agency’s decision is arbitrary and capricious if it is so implausible and contrary to the evidence that it cannot be ascribed to a difference in views or agency expertise but is instead a clear error in judgment.
	* Cite Ethyl Corp. to support interpreting this narrowly to mean there needs to only be a rational basis for the Agency’s decision.

	*  Cite Ethyl Corp., Wilkey, J. (dissenting) to support interpreting this broadly to mean each logical step of the agency’s decision must be supported by facts.
    
**NOTE**: Would a focus on procedural rationality have come out differently? If so, mention that Judge Bazelon’s view in Ethyl Corp. would have made a difference.
