# Statutory Interpretation

## Theories

**textualism** - words speak for themselves; to consider information outside of the text of the statute is illegitimate, as the text represents the result of the legislative process (and whatever compromises that it may comprise)
* [[West Virginia University Hospitals v. Casey]]
* [[Bostock v. Clayton County]]
* [[King v. Burwell]] (kind of)

**purposivisim** - the letter of the law matters less than the purpose of it; look to whatever clues tell you what this statute was trying to accomplish, and interpret this situation in light of the statute's purpose
* [[Riggs v. Palmer]]
* [[King v. Burwell]]  (kind of)
* [[General Dynamics Land Systems v. Cline]] (kind of)

**intentionalism** - the intention of the enacting congress is at the core of the statute; any tools that shed light on the thoughts of those particular individuals at the time the statute was enacted are fair game
* [[U.S. v. Kirby]] (absurdity doctrine)
* [[Public Citizen v. U.S. DOJ]] (absurdity doctrine)

**dynamic statutory interpretation** - just as our social contracts adapt and change over time, so too should our reading of statutes; the purpose, intention, and text settled on by the enacting congress tell us what they were trying to accomplish in the context of their time, and we ought to read their work in the context of ours
* [[Hively v. Ivy Tech]]
* [[Commonwealth v. Welosky]]

## Tools for interpreting statutes

### Text of the statute
* **plain meaning**, see [[Smith v. U.S.]], [[TVA v. Hill]], [[Nix v. Hedden]]
	* **dictionary definition** of a word, see [[Smith v. U.S.]]
	* **idiomatic usage**, see [[General Dynamics Land Systems v. Cline]]
	* **specialized meaning**, see [[Nix v. Hedden]]
	* **common legal usage**, see [[West Virginia University Hospitals v. Casey]]
* **other statutes**, see [[West Virginia University Hospitals v. Casey]]
* **context** in the rest of the statute; dictionary unhelpful without surrounding context, see [[Yates]]
	* do not render other provisions incoherent, see [[Smith v. U.S.]]
* **structure** within the statute
	* Statement of purpose, see [[General Dynamics Land Systems v. Cline]]
	* Start with definition section, see [[Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.]]
	* Nearby provisions, see [[U.S. v. Marshall]]
	* Title of the act, see [[Holy Trinity]]
	* Section headings, see [[Yates]]
	* Placement in the code, see [[Yates]]

#### Semantic Cannons
* ***[[ejusdem generis]]***, see [[McBoyle v. U.S.]]
	* When a list of specific items is followed by a catch-all phrase, the catch-all is restricted to other things of the same type as those listed before it
* ***noscitur a sociis***, see [[General Dynamics Land Systems v. Cline]], [[Gustafson v. Alloyd Co.]]
	* A word gathers meaning from those around it
* ***expresio unius***, see [[Babbitt]]; see also [[NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago]]
	* The inclusion of terms or item should be read as the exclusion of those not listed
* **rule against surplusage**, see [[Babbitt]]; see also [[Yates]]
	* This rule tells us that Congress does not waste ink; language in a statute should not be read to be redundant with other terms in the same statute.
* **presumption of uniform usage**
	* This presumption can be overcome when a word has several commonly understood meanings, see [[General Dynamics Land Systems v. Cline]]
	* Consistent usage across statutes can also be cited, see [[Smith v. U.S.]]

### Legislative History
* **context of evil the statute sought to remedy**
	* If it is clear that the bill was passed to right a certain mischeif, that favors interpretations that are centered around that mischeif, see [[Holy Trinity]]
* **committee reports**, see [[TVA v. Hill]], [[Holy Trinity]]
	* Rank and file members consult these to inform their own understanding of the bill (often without reading the text of the bill)
	* *counter*: these don't reflect the will of Congress as a whole, only the committee
* **statements by legislators**
	* **by bill sponsors** - sometimes given more weight because the sponsor knows the context for the bil
	* **colloquies** - formal back-and-forths between senators, sometimes in hearings, see [[General Dynamics Land Systems v. Cline]], [[Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group]]
	* *counter*: statements represent ideas individuals have, not the intent of Congress as a whole
	* **NOTE**: Do not rely on statements made after the bill passes
* **amendments**
	* A proposed but failed amendment can give insight into what Congress thought was unnecessary to add, or to situations Congress did not want the statute to cover, see [[Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group]]
	* Successful amendments should be assumed to have a real effect (i.e., an interpretation should not be redundant in light of amendments), see [[Babbitt]]
* **earlier drafts of the text**
	* Removing qualifying language during the drafting process signals broad intent by Congress, see [[TVA v. Hill]], [[Public Citizen v. U.S. DOJ]]
* **Congressional silence**
	* If Congress does not object to a commonly held interpretation over time, it is sometimes seen as an implicit endorsement of that interpretation

### Substantive Cannons
* **rule of lenity** - if the meaning of a statute is ambigious or unclear, it should be interpreted in the way most favorable to the defendant, see [[Yates]]; see also [[McBoyle v. U.S.]]
	* But, this cannot dictate an implausible reading of a statute, nor one that is at odds with the generally accepted meaning of a term, see [[Smith v. U.S.]]
* **absurdity cannon** - avoid interpretations that would give absurd results, see [[U.S. v. Kirby]]
	* Absurdity is something that contradicts common sense, see [[U.S. v. Kirby]]
	* Read to avoid injustice, oppression, or an absurd consequence, see [[U.S. v. Kirby]]
	* Avoid a reading that would lead to other absurd results (i.e., not necessarily in these circumstances, but in other circumstances that will plausibly follow), see [[Public Citizen v. U.S. DOJ]]
	* The relativism of what constitutes "absurd" is a critique of this cannon.
* **constitutional avoidance** - if an interpretation would raise constitutional questions, avoid it; no need to address the question itself, see [[NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago]]
	* This cannon can be overcome if the statute clearly and intentionally raises a constitutional question, see [[NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago]]
	* The classical application of the constitutional avoidance cannon requires that the Court actually answer the constitutional question theoretically raised by the case at hand
* **federalism** - the tenth amendment prevents the federal government from intruding on state affairs, see [[Gregory v. Ashcroft]]
	* This cannon can be overcome by a clear statement from Congress that federal rule is supreme in this context
	* This cannon has been applied even when there was no risk of an actual constitutional problem, see [[Gregory v. Ashcroft]]
* **non-delegation** - interpret statutory provisions to restrict agency legislative powers
	* The most radical commitment to the non-delegation doctrine is anti-administrative state (i.e., it is unconstitutional for Congress to delegate legislative powers)
* **no retroactivity** - 
* **no preemption** - 
* **elephant in a mousehole** - presume against Congress hiding an important provision in purely technical language of an obscure section of a statute, see [[King v. Burwell]], [[Whitman v. American Trucking Assn.]]
* **major questions cannon** - assume that Congress would not have left major about agency authority to the agency's discretion, so presume against interpretations that would give that odd result, see [[FDA v. Brown & Williamson]]
	* Used specifically in the context of reviewing the power of agencies
