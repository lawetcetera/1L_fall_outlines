# Morrison v. Olson (1988)
Is the Ethics in Government Act requirement that the attorney general can only fire an independent counsel, who is investigating higher government officians, for cause constitutional?

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - J. Rehnquist
* **Reasoning**
	* The independent counsel is an inferior officer per the following four factors:
		* inferior in rank or degree
		* limited duties
		* limited jurisdiction
		* limited tenure
		* **NOTE**: this new test replaced the test for president's removal power of whether the official was "purely executive"
	* Removal restriction does not violate [[Separation of Powers]] because the independent counsel did not impede the president's ability to perform his constitutional duty
	* The independent counsel requires independence from the president

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Scalia
* **Reasoning**
	* Theory of the Unitary Executive - the president has all executive power, not just some, and the independent counsel is part of the executive branch, so the president should be able to fire (or instruct the attorney general to fire) at will
