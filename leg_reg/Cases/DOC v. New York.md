## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - 
* **Reasoning**
	* The evaluation process was technically proper, but obviously pretextual
	* Though a court may not reject an agency's reasons for doing something, the reasoning must be in good faith
		* Discovery showed that DOC Secretary had asked DOJ to request that he do this, which he used as his justification for doing it.
