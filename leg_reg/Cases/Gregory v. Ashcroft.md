# Gregory v. Ashcroft (1991)
Do Missouri's judges fall within the definition of "employee" in the ADEA, thus rendering Missouri's mandatory retirement age for judges unconstitutional?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. O'Connor
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Federalism]]** - Congress, notable respecter of federalism, would not possibly have meant to disturb the ballance of power between states and the federal government
		* Use the reading of the statute that does not violate federalist principles
		* Clear statement rule, but for federalism

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. White
* **Reasoning**
	* Congress had already outlawed age discrimination by the states; this falls under the commerce clause powers per the Court's jurisprudence on this issue
