# Whitman v. American Trucking Assn. (2001)
Does the Clean Air Act violate the non-delegation doctrine by allowing the EPA to set air quality standards?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Scalia
* **Reasoning**
	* [[Intelligible Principle]] - § 109(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to set air quality standards at the “requisite” level to protect public health
		* “Requisite” standards + margin of safety = sufficiently clear and intelligible principles

## Concurrence
* **Author** - J. Thomas
* **Reasoning**
	* There may still be a constitutional problem; unconvinced in the efficacy of the [[Intelligible Principle]] test

## Concurrence
* **Author** - J. Stevens
* **Reasoning**
	* The Court should just admit that agency rulemaking is "legislative power" and that that's fine
