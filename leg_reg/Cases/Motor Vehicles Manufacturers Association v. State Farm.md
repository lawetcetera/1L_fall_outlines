# Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Association v. State Farm (1983)

How should the substantive rationality of a rule be scrutinized under [[Arbitrary or Capricious Review]]?

## Majority
* **Author** - J. White
* **Reasoning**
	* Revocation of regulation requires just as much reason and justification as establishing new regulation
	* A rule is [[Arbitrary or Capricious Review |Abitrary and Capricious]] if:
		* the agency failks to consider material facts/questions
		* the agency relies on factors Congress did not want them to consider
		* the explanation runs counter to the evidence or is otherwise implausible

## Concurring in Part/Dissenting in Part
* **Author** - J. Rehnquist
* **Reasoning**
	* Under a new administration it is perfectly valid for an agency to change its policy decisions
