# Bostock v. Clayton County (2020)
Are LGBT+ identities protected classes under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - J. Gorsuch
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Text]]** - literalist approach: absent consideration of the individual's sex, discrimination against LGBT+ individuals cannot exist, so this discrimination is "on the basis of sex"

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Alito
* **Reasoning**
	* Whined for 80+ pages about Congress's intent
	* Took a wholly ahistoric approach in imagining what people thought/felt in the sixties

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Kavanaugh
* **Reasoning**
	* Argues for an idiomatic reading of the word "sex"
