# NLRB v. Hearst Publications (1944)

Are newsboys considered employees within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act?

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - J. Rutledge
* **Reasoning**
	* The meaning of "employee" should be determined by underlying economic facts
	* The agency's decision should be accepted if it has a warrant in the record and a reasonable basis in law
		* Pure questions of law are for the courts to decide
		* **[[Mixed question of law and fact]]** require courts to defer to agency discretion

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Roberts
* **Reasoning**
	* The question of a meaning of a term in a statute is for the judiciary, not for the agency
