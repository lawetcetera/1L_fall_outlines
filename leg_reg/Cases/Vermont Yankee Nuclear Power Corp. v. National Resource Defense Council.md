# Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. National Resource Defense Council (1978)

Can courts impose procedural requirements on agencies that go above and beyond those set out by the APA?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Rehnquist
* **Reasoning**
	* Courts may determine what [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]] requires, but they cannot add new procedural requirements to informal rulemaking
	* The requirements set by the APA are both the minimum and maximum requirements
	* Additional procedure doesn't necessarily result in a better outcome
