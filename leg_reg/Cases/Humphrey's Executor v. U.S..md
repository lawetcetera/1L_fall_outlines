# Humphrey's Executor v. U.S. (1935)
Did the president have the authority to remove a federal trade comissioner?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Sutherland
* **Reasoning**
	* FTC officers are quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative figures; this distinguishes this case from Myers, where the removed employee was an executive officer
	* Congress can forbid the removal of its members except for cause
	* Allows for the creation of independent agencies
