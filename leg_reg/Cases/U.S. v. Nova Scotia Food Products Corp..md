# U.S. v. Nova Scotia Food Products Corp. (1977)

Was the procedure used by the United States to regulate the processing of fish under which it tried to enjoin Nova Scotia Foods for its handling of whitefish procedurally flawed?

**NOTE**: This case was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - n/a
* **Reasoning**
	* The implementation of [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]] was flawed
		* The opoprtunity for comment must be meaningful
		* FDA had failed to discolse the scientific studies that formed the basis for its rule
	* Concise statement of basis and purpose must be adequate, where "adequate" means:
		* the agency must respond to pertient comments
		* the agency must consider reasonable alternatives
