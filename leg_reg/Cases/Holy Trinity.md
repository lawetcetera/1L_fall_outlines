# Holy Trinity (1892)
Are clergy members entitled to an exception to the Alien Contract Labor Act?

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - J. Brewer
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Intent]]** - the spirit of the law matters more than the letter; other knowledge workers were listed as exceptions within the text of the statute
	* **[[Role of the Judiciary]] ** - the role of judges is to conform the enforcement of statutes to the intent of the legislature
	* **[[Title]]** - "perform labor" in the title of the statute means manual labor
	* **[[Legislative History]]** - statute must be viewed in the context of when and why Congress enacted it
	* **[[Absurdity Doctrine]]** - failing to let a clergyman into the U.S. would be absurd
