# McBoyle v. U.S. (1931)
Does the term "vehicle" in the Motor Vehicle Act include airplanes?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Holmes
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Text]]** - common usage would indicate that vehicle does not mean airplane
		* **[[eusdem generis]]** - all the vehicles listed are land vehicles, so "vehicle" as a catch all term is only meant to signify land vehicles
	* **[[Legislative History]]** - airplanes existed at the time this bill passed, but were mentioned neither in the reports nor in the debates on the bill
	* **[[Rule of Lenity]]** - given the ambiguity of the term "vehicle," the rule of lenity demands the Court find in favor of McBoyle
