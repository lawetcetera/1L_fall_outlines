# Chocolate Manufacturers Association v. Block (1985)

Does the APA obligate an agency to do a second round of [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]] due to the rule it is enacting having been modified after the initial round?

**NOTE**: This case was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - n/a
* **Reasoning**
	* Notice must provide a fair opportunity for participation in rulemaking
	* A subsequent round is required if changes to the rule are not
		* "in character with the original scheme;" 
		* a "logical outgrowth" from the proposed rule
	* Minor edits in the final rule are okay, but nothing that meets the threholds articulated above
