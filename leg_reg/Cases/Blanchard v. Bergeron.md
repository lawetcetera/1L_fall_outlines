Does statute that awards “reasonable attorney’s fees” for Civil Rights cases cap the fees?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. White
* **Reasoning**
	* [[Committee Report]] - the senate committee report said that the Johnson (a lower court case) twelve factor test, when applied correctly, would result in no cap

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Scalia
* **Reasoning**
