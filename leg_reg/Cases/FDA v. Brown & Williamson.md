# FDA v. Brown & Williamson (2000)

Does the FDA have the authority to regulate nicotine products?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. O'Connor
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Major Questions Cannon]]** - A decision that would have such a sweeping effect on American society would not have been delegated cryptically by Congress
		* Made up here, whole-cloth
	* Were the FDA to abide by its authorizing statute, it would have to ban tobacco
		* but obviously Congress does not want that
	* **[[Legislative History]]** - after enacting the FDA's authorizing statute (FDCA), Congress created a distinct regulatory structure for tobacco
		* Congress also considered and rejected bills that would explicitly give the FDA this authority

## Dissent
* **Author** - J.. Breyer
* **Reasoning**
	* Tobacco products fall within the plain meaning of the statute which grants the FDA power as well as within its purpose
