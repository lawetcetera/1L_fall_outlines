# Buckley v. Valeo (1976)
Does Congress have the power to appoint officers to the Federal Election Commission?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - Per Curiam
* **Reasoning**
	* **Appointment Clause** - the power to appoint "Officers of the United States" is vested only in the President
		* This would be Congress aggrandizing itself
