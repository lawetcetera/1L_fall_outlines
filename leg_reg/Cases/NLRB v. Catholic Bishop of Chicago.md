# NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago (1979)
Does the National Labor Relations Act apply in church-operated schools?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Burger
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Constitutional Avoidance]]** - interpreting this in the affirmative would raise a constitutional question, so let's not even go there
		* Congress would have to make a "clear statement" to indicate intent of raising a constitutional question

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Brennan
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[expressio unius]]** - religious schools are covered unless specifically excluded
	* Constitutional avoidance cannon is meant to be applied against fairly possible interpretations, not as a reach like this
