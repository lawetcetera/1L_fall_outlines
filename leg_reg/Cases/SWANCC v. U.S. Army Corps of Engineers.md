# SWANCC v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (2001)

If an agency's reasonable interpretation during step two of a [[Chevron]] analysis raises a federalism question

## Majority
* **Author** - 
* **Reasoning**
	* The agency's interpretation here fails step one of Chevron
	*  **[[Federalism]]** - here, the necessity of avoiding encroaching on State powers by the federal government trumps deferrence that would be given under Chevron.
		*  Congress gave no clear statement that it intended to raise this constitutional issue

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Stevens
* **Reasoning**
	* CWA’s purpose is to protect the nation’s water. Corps’ jurisdiction over non-navigable waters was decided in earlier cases already. It’s ok to stretch the limits of the Commerce Clause.
