# West Virginia University Hospitals v. Casey (1991)

Does a fee-shifting statute allow the court to award "expert services" fees as a subset of "reasonable attorney's fees"?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Scalia
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Text]]** - the statute only calls for "attorney's fees"; this is unambiguous
	* **[[Other Statutes]]** - other statutes call out "expert witness fees" separately, but the text here does not

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Stevens
* **Reasoning**
	* the purpose of this section was to enable "private attorney generals" to litigate civil rights cases without cost as a prohibitive factor
