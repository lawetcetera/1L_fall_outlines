# Public Citizen v. U.S. DOJ (1989)
Must the president abide by the rules put forth in the Federal Advisory Committee Act when consulting the American Bar Association when nominating judges?

**NOTE**: This is the last SCOTUS case to date that has cited Holy Trinity.

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Brennan
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Absurdity Doctrine]]** - including the ABA would mean that many, many other groups would also be included
	* **[[Intent]]** - Congress couldn't have possibly meant to add this much bureaucracy
	* **[[Legislative History]]** - Kennedy exec order, House Bill, House Report, Senate Bill, Senate Report, Conference [[Committee Report]]

## Concurrence
* **Author** - Kennedy
* **Reasoning**
	* leaning on absurdity is lazy here
	* FACA is unconstitutional per the appointments clause
