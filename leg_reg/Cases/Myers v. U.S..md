# Myers v. U.S. (1926)
Is it constitutional to require the Senate to approve the President’s removal of the Postmaster General?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Taft
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Removal Power]]** - The president has the exclusive power of removing executive officers that were appointed with the advice and consent of the senate
		* Removal power is implicit to the Appointment Clause

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Holmes
* **Reasoning**
	* Congress creates the office, controls its duration, pay, and powers – should be able to control removal

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. McReynolds
* **Reasoning**
	 *	No enumeration of this power to the President in the Constitution. Removal power too broad

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Brandeis
* **Reasoning**
	* No express grant of incidental powers. Many statutes make removal subject to consent of the Senate per Necessary and Proper Clause.
