# U.S. v. Marshall (1990)
When sentencing under the Controlled Substance Act, should the weight of the carrier substance be considered as part of the weight of the drug?

**NOTE**: This decision was handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - J. Easterbrook
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Text]]** - Congress crafted this language carefully, so it should be honored; blotter paper w/ LSD is a "mixture," so gross weight rules
	* **[[Rule of Lenity]]** - does not apply here due 1to the lack of ambiguity in the language
	* **[[Role of the Judiciary]]** - the judiciary must honor the bill that Congress passed

## Dissent - No
* **Author** - J. Posner
* **Reasoning**
	* the pragmatic view is more just here
