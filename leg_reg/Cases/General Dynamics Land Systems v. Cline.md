# General Dynamics Land Systems v. Cline (2004)

Does ADEA which prevents employers from discriminating based on age apply to young workers?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Souter
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Idomatic Usage]]** - the plain meaning of "age" here is colored by its idiomatic connotation of meaning old
	* **[[Varried Usage]]** - within the context of the statute, the word "age" takes on different meanings in different places
	* **[[noscitur a sociis]]** - "a word gathers meaning from those around it"
	* **[[Legislative History]]** - the statute must be read in the context of the mischeif it was trying to solve

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Thomas
* **Reasoning**
	* plain meaning includes discrimination against the young
	* legislative history is irrelevant, but even if used, supports this interpretation
