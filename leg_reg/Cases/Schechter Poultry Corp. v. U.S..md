# Schechter Poultry Corp v. U.S. (1935)
Was the NIRA's delegation of power to the President to approve "codes of fair competition" in support of stable prices, fair labor policies, and monopoly prevention constitutional?

**NOTE**: 1935 was "the one good year" for the non-delegation doctrine.

## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Hughes
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Intelligible Principle]]** - none to be found here, so the delegation of power is theoretically unbounded

## Concurrence
* **Author** - J. Cardozo
* **Reasoning**
	* the delegation of positive functions (i.e., doing good things), as opposed to negative functions (i.e., stopping bad things), is inappropriate
