# Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha (1983)

Is it constitutional for a single chamber resolution (sans public hear or recorded vote) to overturn the Attorney General's decision to suspend deportation of an undocumented individual?

## Majority - No
* **Author** - 
* **Reasoning**
	* **Bicameralism and Presentment** - legislative acts must be approved by both houses and ratified by the president; this scheme lacked those features
	* Veto is an act of legislative power; without it, they must pass a bill

## Concurrence
* **Author** - J. Powell
* **Reasoning**
	* the power delegated in this scheme was judicial, and it lacked any of th e protections of the judicial system
	* **[[Role of the Judiciary]]** - this delegation of judicial power violates the [[Separation of Powers]]

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. White
* **Reasoning**
	* the acts of the AG went against the status quo, thus they were acts of legislation
