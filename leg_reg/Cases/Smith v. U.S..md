# Smith v. U.S.

Does trading a firearm for drugs qualify as "using" it within the meaning of the U.S. criminal code?

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - J. O'Connor
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Text]]** - the plain meaning of "use" is unambiguous (despite this being a case in front of the supreme court where its meaning is at issue)
	* **[[Rule of Lenity]]** - does not apply here, because "use" is not ambiguous

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Scalia
* **Reasoning**
	* ordinary meaning of "using a firearm" is not what the majority says it is
