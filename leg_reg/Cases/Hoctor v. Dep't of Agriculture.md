# Hoctor v. Dep't of Agriculture (1996)

What is the distinction between legislative rules and interpretive rules?

## Majority
* **Author** - J. Posner
* **Reasoning**
	* The USDA's issuance of a height requirement for perimeter fences around animal enclosures was arbitrary
	* The height requirement was not an interpretation of the term "structural strength" in a previous regulation, but was instead a new substantive regulation
