# AMC v. MSHA (1993)

What is the distinction between legislative rules and interpretive rules?

**NOTE**: This case was decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit

## Majority
* **Author** - n/a
* **Reasoning**
	* What is issued by an agency is legislative rather than purely interpretive if:
		* in its absence there would be no basis for enforcement
		* the rule was published in the Code of Federal Regulations
		* it was issued invoking the explicit invocation of authority given by a statute
		* it ammends a prior legislative rule
