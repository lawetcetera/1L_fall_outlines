## Majority - No
* **Author** - J. Marshall
* **Reasoning**
	* [[Legislative History]]
		* Colloquy on the senate floor addressed this exact question in the negative
		* House [[Committee Report]] says it does not
		* The Wolff Amendment would have done this, but it failed; however under the alternate reading, it was superfluous to even propose this amendment
