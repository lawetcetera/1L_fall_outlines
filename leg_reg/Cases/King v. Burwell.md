# King v. Burwell (2015)
Does an ACA Exchange established by the State include Federally established exchanges?

## Majority - Yes
* **Author** - J. Roberts
* **Reasoning**
	* **[[Text]]** - if the statutory language is plain, we must enforce it according to its terms. BUT the "meaning... of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context"
		* Words must be read "in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme"

## Dissent
* **Author** - J. Scalia
* **Reasoning**
	* Use plain meaning, even if the law “falls apart” or results in a “death spiral,” that’s what Congress enacted
	* Words no longer have meaning if an Exchange not established by a State is “established by the State.”
