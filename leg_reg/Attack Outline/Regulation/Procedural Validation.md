# Procedural Validition

Whatever an agency issues, it may be found to be procedurally *sound* or *unsound*.
    
## Interpretive Rule vs. Policy Decision

An agency has issued an interpretive rule if what it issues has the force of law.
1. Without this rule, would there be an adequate legal basis for enforcement?
2. Is this rule codified in the Code of Federal Regulations?
3. Has the agency explicitly invoked its general legislative authority to implement a statute?
4. Does this effectively ammend a prior rule?

A good rule of thumb is, if you can't point to what an interpretive rule is interpreting, it's probably not an interpretive rule. "Guidance documents", "policy statements", "memos", etc., are different from interpretive rules, as they principally deal with policy.

## What did the agency issue?

### Interpretive Rule?

#### Agency issued an interpretive rule
If the document issued by the agency explains the meaning of a statute, the agency has issued an interpretive rule, see [[AMC]]. If what the agency has issued is an interpretive rule, it is not subject to the requirements of [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]].

##### AMC Factors
An agency has issued an interpretive rule if what it issues does not have the force of law. For all of the below, a YES would indicate a binding rule, and all NOs would indicate an interpretive rule.
1. Without this rule, would there be an adequate legal basis for enforcement?
2. Is this rule codified in the Code of Federal Regulations?
3. Has the agency explicitly invoked its general legislative authority to implement a statute?
4. Does this effectively ammend a prior rule, or is it irreconcileable with a prior rule?
	* Remember that ammending an agency's interpretation of a statute is fine here
    
**NOTE**: Any of these factors can be determinative, but courts rarely use the second or third alone. The first factor is the most important.

    
#### Agency did not issue an interpretive rule
Applying [[Hoctor]], this document would be invalid as an interpretive rule.
    
1. The agency is not interpreting a statute, see [[Hoctor]]
    
2. The agency’s rule is [arbitrary and/or inflexible]. As a similar fence height would have been as good as the fence height chosen by the agency in Hoctor, (==analogize from this==) and so the rule is arbitrary, as Judge Posner used the term in [[Hoctor]], and fails to contemplate departures that are just as good.
    

#### Procedural soundness of an interpretive rule
* Interpretive rules are not required to follow [[5 U.S.C. § 553]]'s requirements for [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]], but it is helpful for the agency to include some basis for its decision. ==Address if it did or did not==.
* Though interpretive rules are not required to follow [[5 U.S.C. § 553]]'s requirements for [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]], the agency cannot leave "vital questions" about its decision unanswered, see [[Nova Scotia]]. ==Address if it did or did not.==

    

### Policy Statement?
 A document is a “statement of general policy" if the following conditions hold true:
* It provides insight into the agency's thinking or what it may have on the horizon
* It does not interpret a statute or another rule.
* It does not carry the [[#AMC Factors|force of law]].
* It is not generally applicable and legally binding.

#### Procedural soundness of a policy statement
* Apply the same analysis as is done for [[Procedural Validation#Procedural soundness of an interpretive rule|the soundness of interpretive rules]].

### Legislative Rule?
A legislative rule has the following characteristics:
* It holds the force of law and is generally applicable.

 #### Procedural soundness of a legislative rule
Legislative rules are required to comply with [[5 U.S.C. § 553]] (with [[#Exceptions to § 553 Compliance| some exceptions]])
1. Agencies must give notice of proposed rulemaking, see [[5 U.S.C. § 553#b| § 553(b)]]. 
	* This notice must be published in the Federal Register.
	* Notice must contain “either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.”
	* Notice must include a statement of the time, place, and nature of the proceeding.
2. Agencies must provide an opportunity for meaningful comment on the proposed rulemaking, see [[5 U.S.C. § 553#c| § 553(c)]]; see also [[Nova Scotia]].
	* To allow for meaningful comment, agencies must submit the written data, views, or arguments that are the bases for their proposals.
	* An agency’s disclosures are inadequate if they result in flawed comment, see [[Nova Scotia]].
	* Interested parties must be able to comment and object to the proposed rulemaking, see [[Nova Scotia]].
3. Agencies must provide a concise general statement of basis and purpose, see [[Nova Scotia]]. The general statement must:
	* Provide a concise explanation for the final rule
	* Address “vital” questions of “cogent materiality”
	* Address relevant factors
	* Address alternative proposals
	* Allow courts to see what major policy issues were ventilated by the informal proceedings and why the agency reacted to them as it did
	* Address central objections (but not every objection)
-   (check) If there have been changes to the final rule, the agency is required to give supplemental notice when the changes are neither
	1. in character with the original notice of proposed rulemaking nor 
	2. a logical outgrowth of the original notice and comment period, see [[Chocolate Manufacturers]].

**NOTE**: The agency’s explanation must be contemporaneous in light of the existing administrative record. Unstated reasons may motivate an agency, but the stated reasons must be a basis for its decision. Courts can order further discovery in cases of bad faith, see [[Dept. of Commerce]]

**NOTE**: Agencies must abide by the procedure put forth by the Administrative Procedure Act, and courts cannot ask them implicitly or explicitly to go above and beyond that requirement, see [[Vermont Yankee]]

#### Interim Final Rulemaking
An interim final rule goes straight into effect but takes after-the-fact comment. It has the opportunity to integrate proposals from comments into the final rule within 60 days of the rule having been published.
* This is pretty much what DHS does all the time
* The Court endorsed this process, see [[Little SIsters]]

##### Exceptions to § 553 Compliance
* If the agency did not follow the requirements for [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]] as outlined in the statute, it is not compliant, unless the agency can show the promulgation of this rule fell under one of the following exceptions:
	* what was put forth by the agency was not a legislative rule, but rather an [[#Interpretive Rule]] or a [[#Policy Statement]]
		* the important factor here is that the thing put forth is not binding
	* the agency is part of the military
	* the rule put forth deals only with agency management and personnel, public property, the creation of loans and grants, etc.
	* good cause; following the standard procedures would be unnecessary, impracticable, and/or contrary to the public interest. Some examples follow:
		* rule issued during an emergency (e.g., a global pandemic)
		* not wanting to signal to those breaking the lawe the agency's changes in tradecraft for catching them
		* **NOTE**: in "unneccessary" cases, if a party shows up with a greivance or other input, the agency must begin [[Notice and Comment Rulemaking]] procedures

### Formal Hearing?
Formal hearings have the following characteristics:
* Trial-like proceeding
* Specific to a dispute with particular parties
* Has force of law with regard to this particular dispute

#### Agency held a formal hearing
* A formal hearing is invalid if the agency failed to meet the requirements set forth in [[5 U.S.C. § 556|§ 556]] and [[5 U.S.C. § 557|§ 557]] (e.g., prejudicial lack of oral testimony).
* Agencies may sometimes announce new policies of general applicability in adjudications but only for certain reasons, see [[Chenery|Chenery II]]. If they do, the agency must balance the ill effects of retroactivity against the mischief of product results that are contrary to statutory design or legal and equitable principles. Acceptable reasons to use adjudication for, effectively, case-by-case rulemaking are
	* if a principle must await development through adjudication (like common law)
	* if a situation was unforeseeable
	* if the agency has insufficient experience with a particular problem such that it cannot make a solid rule
	* if the problem is too specialized or varying in nature to capture in a rule
-   The record must be a contemporaneous basis for the agency’s decision, not an ad hoc one, see [[Chenery#Chenery I|Chenery I]].
