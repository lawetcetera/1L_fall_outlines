# Statutory Interpretation

## Theories

**textualism** - words speak for themselves; to consider information outside of the text of the statute is illegitimate, as the text represents the result of the legislative process (and whatever compromises that it may comprise)

**purposivisim** - the letter of the law matters less than the purpose of it; look to whatever clues tell you what this statute was trying to accomplish, and interpret this situation in light of the statute's purpose

**intentionalism** - the intention of the enacting congress is at the core of the statute; any tools that shed light on the thoughts of those particular individuals at the time the statute was enacted are fair game

**dynamic statutory interpretation** - just as our social contracts adapt and change over time, so too should our reading of statutes; the purpose, intention, and text settled on by the enacting congress tell us what they were trying to accomplish in the context of their time, and we ought to read their work in the context of ours

## Tools for interpreting statutes

### Text of the statute
* Dictionary definition of a word, see [[Smith]]
* Everyday usage of a word or phrase, see [[McBoyle]]
* Use in other statutes or by the judiciary, see [[Casey]]
* Context in the rest of the statute:
	* Statement of purpose,, see [[General Dynamics]]
	* Nearby provisions, see [[Marshall]]
	* Title of the act, see [[Holy Trinity]]
	* Section headings, see [[Yates]]
	* Placement in the code, see [[Yates]]

#### Semantic Cannons
* *ejusdem generis*, see [[McBoyle]]
	* When a list of specific items is followed by a catch-all phrase, the catch-all is restricted to other things of the same type as those listed before it
* *noscitur a sociis*, see [[General Dynamics]]
	* A word gathers meaning from those around it
* *expresio unius*, see [[Babbitt]]; see also [[NLRB]]
	* The inclusion of terms or item should be read as the exclusion of those not listed
* rule against surplusage, see [[Babbitt]]; see also [[Yates]]
	* This rule tells us that Congress does not waste ink; language in a statute should not be read to be redundant with other terms in the same statute.
* presumption of uniform usage
	* This presumption can be overcome when a word has several commonly understood meanings, see [[General Dynamics]]
	* Consistent usage across statutes can also be cited, see [[Smith]]

### Legislative History
* committee reports
* statements by legislators
	* colloquies
	* 
* ammendments
* later legislative action
* earlier drafts of the text

### Substantive Cannons
* **rule of lenity** - if the meaning of a statute is ambigious or unclear, it should be interpreted in the way most favorable to the defendant, see [[Yates]]; see also [[McBoyle]]
	* But, this cannot dictate an implausible reading of a statute, nor one that is at odds with the generally accepted meaning of a term, see [[Smith]]
* **absurdity cannon** - avoid interpretations that would give absurd results, see [[Kirby]]
	* Absurdity is something that contradicts common sense, see [[Kirby]]
	* Read to avoid injustice, oppression, or an absurd consequence, see [[Kirby]]
	* Avoid a reading that would lead to other absurd results (i.e., not necessarily in these circumstances, but in other circumstances that will plausibly follow), see [[Public Citizen]]
	* The relativism of what constitutes "absurd" is a critique of this cannon.
* **constitutional avoidance** - 
	* The classical application of the constitutional avoidance cannon requires that the Court actually answer the constitutional question theoretically raised by the case at hand
* **federalism** - 
* **non-delegation** - 
* **no retroactivity** - 
* **no preemption** - 
* **elephant in a mousehole** - 
* **major questions cannon** - assume that Congress would not have left major about agency authority to the agency's discretion, so presume against interpretations that would give that odd result, see [[Brown & Williamson]]
	* Used specifically in the context of reviewing the power of agencies
