Mortgagee’s duty of good faith and due diligence in the role as a seller is essentially that of a fiduciary, and therefore must exert every reasonable effort to obtain “a fair and reasonable price under the circumstances”
* Fair price depends on the case – the price alone might not be sufficient unless it’s shockingly low
    
Sellers failed to exercise due diligence in obtaining a fair price – i.e. a reasonable man in the lender’s place would have adjourned the sale
* *Appraised price for property was $46,000, therefore P’s equity in the house was at least $46,000-$27,000 (amount owed) = $19,000
    
* Lender sold the house for a price that was sufficient to cover all costs but did not provide a return for any of mortgagor’s equity
    
* Lenders also had reason to know that they stood to make a large profit on a quick turnaround sale
    * They did not have to know specific buyers before the sale, the fact that they offered $40,000 shows that they knew that they knew they could make a large profit
    
Mortgagees acted in good faith, and had substantial equity, therefore lenders had a fiduciary duty to make more reasonable steps to protect mortgagor’s equity by attempting to obtain a fair price
* They could have set a minimum price or advertised to have other bidders present at the sale, but they did not give notice to the general public
    
 Lower court erred in awarding damages
 * Not the difference between fair market value and sell price (formula for bad faith)
 * It should have been difference between fair price and sell price (formula for lack of due diligence)
    
Court didn’t simply give the house back to the Murphys because the bank sold the house to a “bona fide purchaser for value” – a good faith purchaser at fair market value, who couldn’t have known these problems
*  If the sale was overturned, it would impact foreclosure markets as buyers would hesitate to deal with banks if they know a sale can be overturned
