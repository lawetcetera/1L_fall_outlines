# Principles of Property Law
## Property First Principles
1. Property rights are always relative to the property rights of others, see [[Pierson v. Post]]; see also [[Van Valkenburgh v. Lutz]]. This includes the public interest.
2. They exist on a timeline, and over time they will change.
3. Property is not a thing; it is about the relationships between people concerning things.

## Goals of Property Law
1. Protect the intent of the parties, especially the grantor.
2. Protect the integrity of the recording system. Prioritize the interests of those who use it over those who fail to do so.
3. Protect bona fide purchasers from interests of which they did not have notice.
4. Encourage the use of land.
5. Preserve the alienability of land.
