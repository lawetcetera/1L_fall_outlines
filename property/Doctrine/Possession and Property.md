# Possession and Property
## Property First Principles
Property rights are always relative to the property rights of others, see [[Pierson v. Post]]; see also [[Van Valkenburgh v. Lutz]]. They exist on a timeline, and over time they will change.

## Possession
Possession can be *actual* or *constructive*:
* **actual possession** - physical possession
* **constructive possession** - having controlling access to something without physically posessing it
	* In general, "constructive" signals to pretend that whatever noun it's modifying is real

Possession confers a right to exclude others from possession of your thing. Prior posessors are generally held to have a greater right to a thing than subsequent possessors.

### Rationale
* Possession implies control; a standard of anything less than control opens the gate for more ambiguity (and subsequently, more litigation)
* Possession gives a point of certainty in property rights
* Possession usually requires an investment of effort, time, or other resources. The law seeks to reward that effort

## Capture
### *ferae naturae*
The rule of capture articulated in [[Pierson v. Post]] tells us that a person who captures a resource and brings it within her control is entitled to it. Mere pursuit is not enough; only possession, actual or constructive, confers property rights.
* With regard to wild animals, mortal wounding is regarded as constructive possession

### *ratione soli*
The doctrine of *ratione soli* tells us that the owner of land also owns what is on it. This can also be thought of as a form of constructive possession.
* Should a wild animal wander onto your property, you have a greater property interest in it than your neighbor. Should it wander from your property to your neighbor's, he then will have a greater property interest in it than you.

### *ad coelom*
The doctrine of *ad coelom* captures the common law principle that "Who owns the surface, owns the skies above and the depths below," see [[Hammonds v. Central KY Natural Gas]]. Thus, mineral rights run with the land. Rights to airspace used to as well, but that was generally done away with after the advent of airplanes.

[[Hammonds v. Central KY Natural Gas|Hammonds]] went on to apply the rule of *[[#ferae naturae]]* to mineral rights, holding that natural gas belonged to whomever had it in their possession.
* Though only the owner of land has the right to develop an extraction rig on that land (unless they have sold that right), others who own property over the same reservoir have a right to extract natural gas on their own property and may drink your milkshake.

## Adverse Possession
Adverse possession is the vehicle through which the law rewards someone who uses property as opposed to someone who fails to do so.

### Test for Adverse Possession
Adverse possession is governed by state law, so it varies between jurisdictions. Generally, in order to claim adverse possession, one must meet each of the following criterea:
1. Actual Entry - the possessor must actually be on the land.
	* This tolls the limitations period in many jurisdictions.
	* This gives notice (actual or constructive) to the property owner.
	* The possessor will only gain title over the parts of the property that they actually occupy and bears the burden of proving these boundaries.
2. Exclusive Entry - the possessor must demonstrate an effort to keep others off the land
	* Prior adverse possessors have a superior claim to subsequent adverse possessors. Some jurisdictions will reset the limitations clock on an adverse possessor if her possession is interrupted by a subsequent adverse possessor; others allow it to continue, and still others pause it.
3. Open and Notorious - the possessor cannot use the land in a clandestine manner; in order to lay claim to it, their use must be open and easily detectable
	* This is another strategy through which the law mandates notice be given to the owner.
4. Hostile and Under a Claim of Right - the possessor must have the intent of possessing the land
	* Permission to occupy the land given by its owner strips the possessor of having claim of right over it.
	* The possessor's intent may be held in bad faith, to hope to get property for free, or it may be held in good faith, under the impression that the land is actually his. Most jurisdictions hold that it doesn't matter.
5. Continuous - the possessor must continuously occupy the premises for the full limitations period
	* This is not to be construed literally, as never ever leaving the property, but rather ought to be construed to mean the possessor must occupy the property as an owner would. For example, occupying a summer home only in the summers qualifies as continuous, see [[Howard v. Kunto]].
6. Other Elements
	* Some jurisdictions have additional requirements, such as the payment of property taxes while possessing the land, or having "usually cultivate[d] or improve[d]" it, see [[Van Valkenburgh v. Lutz]].

### Mechanics of Adverse Possession
As stated above, adverse possession starts when the possessor enters the property. **Should an owner wish to defend their land against the possessor**, the owner may either give him permission to be on the property, kick him off of the property, or start a lawsuit against him. Each of these actions either pauses the limitations clock, or resets it entirely.

An **owner who transfers** adversely possessed land transfers the possessor with it; the possessor's limitations clock keeps running with the land.

An adverse possessor may **only lay claim to what the owner possessed**; were the owner an heir to property with only a [[Estates in Land#Life Estate|life estate]], a subsequent heir would have a greater claim to the property following the death of the original owner than the possessor would.

A voluntary and valid transfer of land from a possessor to a purchaser leaves the limitations clock running because the purchaser is in **privity** of estate with the possessor.

Land cannot be adversely possessed against an owner who exeriences extraneous circumstances that affect legal status and land use (e.g., **minority, imprisonment, disability**) if and until these circumstances are ameliorated.

Land that is used regularly by the public without the owner's permission is subject to **public prescriptive easements**. These confer a nonexclusive property usage right to members of the public.

#### Policy Considerations of Adverse Possession
* Adverse possession incentivizes land use, and punishes landowners who hoard land without using it.
* It can effectuate justice by aligning ownership rights on paper with land usage in reality.
* A stance in favor of adverse possession is generally opposed to absolute property rights.
