# Real Estate Transactions
## Contracts: purchase and sale agreements
### Parties in play
**Parties to the sale**
* **Seller** - trying to maximize price; emotionally invested in property
* **Buyer** - trying to minimize price
* **Lender** (kind of) - wants return on investment

**Agents**
* **Seller's agent** - trying to maximize price and minimize closing time
* **Buyer's agent** - trying to maximize price and minimize closing time

Agents make money by comission. Except in cases of very high-end real estate, their primary concern is volume of sales. Buyer's agents, usually unbeknownst to the buyer, have a fiduciary duty to disclose information to the seller's agent. Since the agent commission is usally six percent of the closing price of the property, it is split between the buyer's agent and seller's agent (three percent each), then further split between each agent and their respective firm (one point five percent each). Firms will try to arrange transactions such that both agents are from the same firm. In that situation, the firm and each agent will usually take two percent of the closing price.

**Lawyers**
* **Seller's counsel** - wants slow closing
* **Buyer's counsel** - wants slow closing

Lawyers try to push for every possible advantage for their clients. They are under no financial incentive to close a deal.

### Bona Fide Purchasers
*Bona fide purchasers* are purchasers without actual or constructive notice of encumberances, other claims of title, etc.

Courts try to protect bona fide purchasers who pay valuable consideration and act in good faith.

When a title is voidable, the true owner can rescind the transaction and get her property back from the wrongdoer, but she cannot get property back from a bona fide purchaser.

### Timeline of a sale
1. **Listing**
2. **Purchase and sale agreement**
3. **Executory period** - typically a month, refered to colloquially as "closing period"
	1. A lawsuit here seeks *specific performance* or *recision*
4. **Closing** - the day the deal is finalized
	1. A lawsuit here seeks *damages*.

### Statute of Frauds - Contract of Sale
See: [[Hickley v. Green]]

A contract for the sale of real property is always subject to the Statute of Frauds. The writing need not be formal or in the form of a single document. It does require the signatures of both parties.

**NOTE**: Deeds that violate the Statute of Frauds are void, even if recorded. Contracts of sale that violate the Statute of Frauds are voidable.

**Elements**
* Written document
* Signed by the party to be bound
* Describes the real estate
* States an intention to convey said real estate
* States the agreed upon price, or the ageed upon method of determining a price (e.g., fair market value)

**Exceptions**
* **Part performance**
	* A purchaser, acting in reasonable reliance on an oral contract, can prove its existence and except the contract from the Statute of Frauds if she does the the blow in such a way that would only make sense had an oral contract existed and proves that she would suffer *irreparable* harm were the agreement not to be enforced.
		* She pays the contract price
			* Usually necessary but not sufficient. May entitle purchaser to restitution, but probably not to specific performance.
		* She takes possession of the property
			* Purchaser must physically move onto the property. Stronger claim if she incurred substantial moving expenses.
		* She improves the property
			* The improvement must be substantial such that it increases the value of the property.
* **Estoppel**
	* An *unconscionable* injury would result from enforcement of the oral contract after one party has been induced by the other seriously to change his position in reliance on the contract. The following elements must be proven:
		* the existence of a definite oral contract
		* acts that refer to, result from, or are made in pursuance of the agreement
		* a refusal to execute the agreement would place the moving party in a situation not remediable by damages

**NOTE**: The *irreparable* standard used by part performance is a lower bar to meet in litigation than the *unconscionable* standard used by estoppel. In either case, these are high bars to meet.

### Marketable title
See: [[Lohmeyer v. Bower]]

In a purchase and sale agreement for real property, the seller has an implied contractual duty to deliver marketable title to the buyer (i.e., (1) free from reasonable doubt as to its marketability, and (2) does not expose purchaser to the hazard of litigation).
* **NOTE**: this is in the purchase and sale agreement rather than the deed. The deed may still contain encumberances

A purchasers acceptance of a title deems it marketable.

Marketable title is not the same as marketability. A marketable title is a fee simple interest in a property wherein the title is free from encumberances and the buyer is entitled to possession.

**Examples of Unmarketable Title**
* Defect in the chain of title
* Encumberances that render the title unmarketable
	* Unless the encomberance is a beneficial easement known to the buyer
	* Unless the encumberance is a restrictive covenant that does not limit the use specified in the purchase and sale agreement
	* Unless the contract contains a clause which says "subject to all restrictions of record," and the restrictions were properly recorded

**Encumberances** ^27238e
* Pecuniary charge against the property (e.g., mortgages, judgement liens)
* Estates or interests in the property (e.g., leases, life estates)
* Easements or servitudes on the land

### Duty to disclose defects

The doctrine of *caveat emptor* holds that the seller has no duty to disclose any information to the contracting parties unless there is a confidential or fiduciary relationship between herself and the parties. Including a clause requiring inspection is a way the purchaser may protect himself.

Modern jurisprudence has created a *duty to disclose* conditions that are:
* created by the seller;
* materially impair the value of the contract; and
* are peculiarly within the knowledge of the seller such that they are unlikely to be discovered by a prudent purchaser exercising due care with respect to the transaction

Remedies available for breach of duty to disclose include recision (if the sale is still in its executory period) or damages (after closing). However, courts are generally redisent to impose liability on the seller, so the defect must be substantial.

## Property: deeds

### Statute of Frauds - Deeds

Deeds are subject to the Statute of Frauds.
* The deed must be in writing
* The deed must be signed by the grantor
* The deed must contain:
	* Identification of the parties
	* Sufficient description of the parties
	* The price, or a definite method to determine it (though courts have accepted "a reasonable price")
	* An intention to convey the property

Deeds need not be formal nor contained in a single doucment.

**NOTE**: a deed that does not satisfy the Statue of Frauds is void.

In order for a deed to be recorded, most jurisdictions require that the grantor's signature be notraized.

### Types of deeds
See: [[Rockafellor v. Gray]]

* **General Warranty** - Warrants title against *all* defects, whether they arose before or after the grantor took title.
* **Special Warranty** - Warrants title against defects which arose *during the grantor's tenure*. Does not warrant against defects which arose during the tenure of previous owners.
* **Quitclaim** - No warranties of any kind, merely conveys title to the property as-is.

Most deeds require an acknowledgement that some consideration was paid by the grantee, though need not necessarily state what that consideration was.

Deeds must contain a description of the land, referencing either:
* References to natural or artificial landmarks as well as directions and distances ("metes and bounds")
* Reference to a government survey
* Reference to the street and number (or the name) of the property

Some jurisdictions require deed contain a seal, though a seal can be almost anything.

Forged deeds are void. The grantor whose signature was forged prevails over all other interests, including subsequent bona fide purchasers. This is an exception to the rule that generally favors the claim of subsequent bona fide purchasers (even in instances of fraud).

### Express warranties of a General Warranty Deed
* **Present covenants** - if they are broken, they are broken at the moment of transfer
	* *covenant of seisin* - warrants the grantor owns the estate he purports to convey
	* *covenant of right to convey* - warrants the grantor has the right to convey the estate
	* *covenant against encumberances* - warrants that there are no [[#^27238e|encumberances]] on the property
* **Future covenants**
	* *covenant of general warranty* - warrants the grantee will have the superior claim to the property
	* *covenant of quiet enjoyment* - warrants the grantee will not be disturbed in possession and enjoyment by assertion of a superior title
	* *covenant of further assurances* - warrants that the grantor will execute any other documents required to perfect the title conveyed
* **Remedies for breach**
	* breach of the covenant of seisin
		* return all or portion of the purchase price
		* majority of jurisdictions hold breach even if the grantee had knowledge of the defect/easement
	* breach of the covenant against encumberances
		* for encumberances easily removed, the cost of removal
		* for encumberances not easily removed, the difference in value between the land with and without the encumberance
		* Damages are limited by the total price received by the warrantor
		* Think expectation damages -- tries to put the warantee in as good of a position as they'd be in if the covenant were not to have been breached
	* breach of future covenants
		* the grantee must be in possession of the property in order to sue on future covenant
		* the statute of limitations begins to run on a future covenant at the time of eviction or when the covenant is broken

### Delivery of the deed
See: [[Rosengrant v. Rosengrant]]

To constitute a transfer, a deed must be:
1. In writing
2. Physically delivered to the grantee or their agent
	* Title passes upon delivery, and the passage of title cannot be undone. A new deed would be required for a new transfer, even if just back to the grantor.
	* Recording a deed puts third parties on constructive notice, but does not affect the validity of the deed or its transfer.
	* Title can be conveyed through a third party (typically in escrow)
	* Physical delivery must be made with intent to pass title in order to consitute a legal delivery.
	* The requirement of physical delivery has its roots in the livery of seisin.

## Money: mortgages, financing, and foreclosure

### How mortgages work

1. Buyer applies for a mortgage
	* the buyer is the mortgagor, the bank is the mortgagee
2. Lender checks buyer's credit, earnings, job security, etc. If approved, the lender will issue a commitment to provide financing on *specified terms*, within a *specified time period*
3. Borrowers must give leder a promissory note and a mortgage
	* The promissory note creates personal liability
	* The mortgagee requires the mortgagor to execute a mortgage on some specific property. The mortgagee can foreclose on this property if the mortgagor fails to make payments or does not perform their contractual obligations
4.  Borrower makes a down payment.

In about half of all states, the mortgagor has a statutory right to buy back the title from the purchaser at a judicial foreclosure sale for the sales price within a specific period after the foreclosure sale

**NOTE**: There is no national uniform mortgage law

### Mortgage foreclosure
See: [[Murphy v. Fin. Dev. Corp.]]
 A *deed of trust* allows lenders to avoid judicial foreclosure 
* The borrower conveys title to a person to hold in trust to secure payment to the lender. The trustee is given the power to sell the land without going to court in the event of default.

A *power of sale mortgage* gives the mortgagee the power to sell in the case of foreclosure.
* A foreclosure sale is conducted by a representative of the lender as opposed to an agent of the state
* Most often, the lender bids and wins because these sales are not widely advertised, foreclosure sales are cash only, and the risk associated with foreclosure purchases is high. The lender will often only bid the amount due to them, so that they do not have to pay out to the mortagor's accumulated equity.
* Courts generally require *good faith and due diligence* on the part of the bank when conducting a foreclosure sale
	* *due diligence* - the mortgagee must try to secure a reasonable portion of the owner's equity
	* *bad faith* - "intentional disregard of duty or purpose to injure"
		* Sellers who fail to obtain a fair price have not necessarily acted in bad faith.



## Protecting Title: Recording
### The recording system

Recording tracks the ownership of property in a jurisdiction (usually municipalities). Recording serves to protect subsequent bona fide purchasers from prior unrecorded interests.

**Functions and Benefits**
* A recorded deed provides constructive notice
* Assures purchasers that they have good title to the land they purchase
* Establishes a system of public recordation and land titles
* Preserves important documents in a secure location
* Protects purchasers for value and lien creditors against prior unrecorded interests

### Title searches
See: [[Guillette v. Daly Dry Wall]]

The actual title records are very long and cumbersome to search. In order to render them usable, title indexes are maintained to assist those performing title searches

**Types of title indexes**
* *Grantor-Grantee Index* - Indices of transactions indexed by the surnames of parties to exchanges.
	* Separate indices are kept for grantors and grantees
	* Contain metadata about the property and the transaction
		* Grantor, grantee, description of land, kind of instrument, date, volume, and page numbers where the instrument may be found
	* Grantor index: all instruments are indexed alphabetically and chronologically
	* Grantee index: all instruments are indexed under the grantee's surname
	* This enables searches to be done [[#^f0ad72|first backward and then forward]]
* *Tract Index* - Indices of transactions indexed by property
	* Indexing by tract is not as easy as it sounds-- tracts are often broken up or recombined, making them difficult to track over long periods of time
	* These do not exist in most states
	* Kept most often by realtors; serve as a secondary set of records in the event of loss (e.g., town hall burns down)

**Searching title** ^f0ad72
* Starting with the present owner, search backward in time to an acceptable source or root of title through the grantor index and then forward in time through the grantee index.
	* Some jurisdictions require a search back to the sovereign, others require only a number of years fixed by statute
	* A purchaser is responsible for searching other deeds that have a common grantor in order to check for express restrictions on the property being purchased. This protects the expectations of other lot owners

### Recording Acts
Types of recording statutes:
* **Race Statute** - (depricated) the first to record a purchase prevails in questions of title
	* Being aware of a superior claim of title does not matter so long as you are the first to record your interest
	* This encourages the use of and reliance on the recording system
	* Easy to administer
* **Notice Statute** - subsequent purchasers can claim superior title only if they had no notice of the prior purchaser's claim
	* Whether actual or constructive notice is required varries by jurisdiction
	* This promotes fairness and justice
	* Hard to administer 
* **Race-Notice Statute** - subsequent purchasers can claim superior title only if they record first and had no notice of the prior purchaser's claim
	* Promotes the use of and reliance on the recording system
	* Tends to eliminate lawsuits based on extrinsic evidence about which deed was delivered first
	* Medium difficulty to administer


About half of states have notice statutes, about half have race-notice statutes.
