# Real Estate Transactions
## Contracts: purchase and sale agreements
### Parties in play
**Parties to the sale**
* **Seller** - trying to maximize price; emotionally invested in property
* **Buyer** - trying to minimize price
* **Lender** (kind of) - wants return on investment

**Agents**
* **Seller's agent** - trying to maximize price and minimize closing time
* **Buyer's agent** - trying to maximize price and minimize closing time

Agents make money by comission. Except in cases of very high-end real estate, their primary concern is volume of sales. Buyer's agents, usually unbeknownst to the buyer, have a fiduciary duty to disclose information to the seller's agent. Since the agent commission is usally six percent of the closing price of the property, it is split between the buyer's agent and seller's agent (three percent each), then further split between each agent and their respective firm (one point five percent each). Firms will try to arrange transactions such that both agents are from the same firm. In that situation, the firm and each agent will usually take two percent of the closing price.

**Lawyers**
* **Seller's counsel** - wants slow closing
* **Buyer's counsel** - wants slow closing

Lawyers try to push for every possible advantage for their clients. They are under no financial incentive to close a deal.

### Timeline of a sale
1. **Listing**
2. **Purchase and sale agreement**
3. **Executory period** - typically a month, refered to colloquially as "closing period"
	1. A lawsuit here seeks *specific performance* or *recision*
4. **Closing** - the day the deal is finalized
	1. A lawsuit here seeks *damages*.

### Statute of Frauds - Contract of Sale
See: [[Hickley v. Green]]

A contract for the sale of real property is always subject to the Statute of Frauds. The writing need not be formal or in the form of a single document. It does require the signatures of both parties.

**NOTE**: Deeds that violate the Statute of Frauds are void, even if recorded. Contracts of sale that violate the Statute of Frauds are voidable.

**Elements**
* Written document
* Signed by the party to be bound
* Describes the real estate
* States an intention to convey said real estate
* States the agreed upon price, or the ageed upon method of determining a price (e.g., fair market value)

**Exceptions**
* **Part performance**
	* A purchaser, acting in reasonable reliance on an oral contract, can prove its existence and except the contract from the Statute of Frauds if she does the the blow in such a way that would only make sense had an oral contract existed and proves that she would suffer *irreparable* harm were the agreement not to be enforced.
		* She pays the contract price
			* Usually necessary but not sufficient. May entitle purchaser to restitution, but probably not to specific performance.
		* She takes possession of the property
			* Purchaser must physically move onto the property. Stronger claim if she incurred substantial moving expenses.
		* She improves the property
			* The improvement must be substantial such that it increases the value of the property.
* **Estoppel**
	* An *unconscionable* injury would result from enforcement of the oral contract after one party has been induced by the other seriously to change his position in reliance on the contract. The following elements must be proven:
		* the existence of a definite oral contract
		* acts that refer to, result from, or are made in pursuance of the agreement
		* a refusal to execute the agreement would place the moving party in a situation not remediable by damages

**NOTE**: The *irreparable* standard used by part performance is a lower bar to meet in litigation than the *unconscionable* standard used by estoppel. In either case, these are high bars to meet.

### Marketable title
See: [[Lohmeyer v. Bower]]

In a purchase and sale agreement for real property, the seller has an implied contractual duty to deliver marketable title to the buyer (i.e., (1) free from reasonable doubt as to its marketability, and (2) does not expose purchaser to the hazard of litigation).
* **NOTE**: this is in the purchase and sale agreement rather than the deed. The deed may still contain encumberances

A purchasers acceptance of a title deems it marketable.

Marketable title is not the same as marketability. A marketable title is a fee simple interest in a property wherein the title is free from encumberances and the buyer is entitled to possession.

**Examples of Unmarketable Title**
* Defect in the chain of title
* Encumberances that render the title unmarketable
	* Unless the encomberance is a beneficial easement known to the buyer
	* Unless the encumberance is a restrictive covenant that does not limit the use specified in the purchase and sale agreement
	* Unless the contract contains a clause which says "subject to all restrictions of record," and the restrictions were properly recorded

**Encumberances** ^27238e
* Pecuniary charge against the property (e.g., mortgages, judgement liens)
* Estates or interests in the property (e.g., leases, life estates)
* Easements or servitudes on the land

### Duty to disclose defects

The doctrine of *caveat emptor* holds that the seller has no duty to disclose any information to the contracting parties unless there is a confidential or fiduciary relationship between herself and the parties. Including a clause requiring inspection is a way the purchaser may protect himself.

Modern jurisprudence has created a *duty to disclose* conditions that are:
* created by the seller;
* materially impair the value of the contract; and
* are peculiarly within the knowledge of the seller such that they are unlikely to be discovered by a prudent purchaser exercising due care with respect to the transaction

Remedies available for breach of duty to disclose include recision (if the sale is still in its executory period) or damages (after closing). However, courts are generally redisent to impose liability on the seller, so the defect must be substantial.

## Property: deeds

### Statute of Frauds - Deeds

Deeds are subject to the Statute of Frauds.
* The deed must be in writing
* The deed must be signed by the grantor
* The deed must contain:
	* Identification of the parties
	* Sufficient description of the parties
	* The price, or a definite method to determine it (though courts have accepted "a reasonable price")
	* An intention to convey the property

Deeds need not be formal nor contained in a single doucment.

**NOTE**: a deed that does not satisfy the Statue of Frauds is void.

In order for a deed to be recorded, most jurisdictions require that the grantor's signature be notraized.

### Types of deeds
See: [[Rockafellor v. Gray]]

* **General Warranty** - Warrants title against *all* defects, whether they arose before or after the grantor took title.
* **Special Warranty** - Warrants title against defects which arose *during the grantor's tenure*. Does not warrant against defects which arose during the tenure of previous owners.
* **Quitclaim** - No warranties of any kind, merely conveys title to the property as-is.

Most deeds require an acknowledgement that some consideration was paid by the grantee, though need not necessarily state what that consideration was.

Deeds must contain a description of the land, referencing either:
* References to natural or artificial landmarks as well as directions and distances ("metes and bounds")
* Reference to a government survey
* Reference to the street and number (or the name) of the property

Some jurisdictions require deed contain a seal, though a seal can be almost anything.

Forged deeds are void. The grantor whose signature was forged prevails over all other interests, including subsequent bona fide purchasers. This is an exception to the rule that generally favors the claim of subsequent bona fide purchasers (even in instances of fraud).

### Express warranties of a General Warranty Deed
* **Present covenants** - if they are broken, they are broken at the moment of transfer
	* *covenant of seisin* - warrants the grantor owns the estate he purports to convey
	* *covenant of right to convey* - warrants the grantor has the right to convey the estate
	* *covenant against encumberances* - warrants that there are no [[#^27238e|encumberances]] on the property
* **Future covenants**
	* *covenant of general warranty* - warrants the grantee will have the superior claim to the property
	* *covenant of quiet enjoyment* - warrants the grantee will not be disturbed in possession and enjoyment by assertion of a superior title
	* *covenant of further assurances* - warrants that the grantor will execute any other documents required to perfect the title conveyed
* **Remedies for breach**
	* breach of the covenant of seisin
		* return all or portion of the purchase price
	* breach of the covenant against encumberances
		* for encumberances easily removed, the cost of removal
		* for encumberances not easily removed, the difference in value between the land with and without the encumberance
		* Damages are limited by the total price received by the warrantor
		* Think expectation damages -- tries to put the warantee in as good of a position as they'd be in if the covenant were not to have been breached

### Delivery of the deed
See: [[Rosengrant v. Rosengrant]]

To constitute a transfer, a deed must be:
1. In writing
2. Physically delivered to the grantee or their agent
	* Title passes upon delivery, and the passage of title cannot be undone. A new deed would be required for a new transfer, even if just back to the grantor.
	* Recording a deed puts third parties on constructive notice, but does not affect the validity of the deed or its transfer.
	* Title can be conveyed through a third party (typically in escrow)
	* Physical delivery must be made with intent to pass title in order to consitute a legal delivery.
	* The requirement of physical delivery has its roots in the livery of seisin.
