# Leasehold Estates (Landlord-Tenant)
## Creating and transferring leasehold estates

### Types of Leasehold Estates

**Tenancy at Will** -  a leasehold with no fixed period of time. It lasts as long as both parties want it to last. Landlord can terminate the tenancy for no reason (no violations of any conditions).
* A tenancy of uncertain duration that is terminable whenever one party wishes may be a tenancy at will, but some courts have found it to be a determinable leasehold life estate, see [[Garner v. Gerrish]]
	* In contrast, a leasehold with a determinable term and terminable at the will of only one party is a term of years.
	* The Garner court considered the old common law rule that a lease terminable by one party is terminable by both, but ultimately rejected it; though the lease agreement is poorly drawn up, the intentions of the parties seemed to be a determinable life estate.
* May be created by agreement or law.

**Periodic Tenancy** - A lease for a recurring period of time that continues in existence until either party gives advance notice for termination.
* For year-to-year tenancy, 6 months advance notice required.
* Notice equal to the period, for periods of 6 months or less.
	* Some statutes make the notice period shorter by one month.
* May be created by agreement or law. When by law, period length is usually determined by how frequently the rent is paid. (Termination date is always uncertain.)

**Term of Years** - lease for a single, fixed term of any length.
* A term may be indefinite as long as its length can be computed by reference to some formula (think definiteness/agreements to agree from contracts)
	* If the term is unclear, the lease becomes a tenancy at will
* A term of years may be made defeasible on the occurrence of some uncertain future event

**Tenancy at Sufferance** - A tenant that maintains possession after the term has expired until the landlord decides what to do.
* Within X period, landlord must either evict and recover damages or bind the person to a new term as a tenant. The landlord cannot change his mind after choosing between these options

### The Lease
A lease is both a conveyance and a contract, so it is governed by an amalgamation of the law of Property and the law of Contracts.
* It transfers a promissory interest in land, but also conveys several promises and creates contract rights
* Traditionally leases were treated more like conveyances, but courts have shifted over time towards using contract principles to deal with them

Leases longer than one year are subject to the Statute of Frauds. Many jurisdictions subject all leases to the Statute of Frauds. This requires leases to be in writing, rather than to be made orally.

Sometimes, arrangements that resemble leases may be held by courts to be licenses or life estates instead.
* Factors that affect this include:
	* Intention of the parties
	* Restrictions on use
	* Exclusivity of possession
	* Degree of control retained by the grantor, etc.

### Privity

Privity is a voluntary transactional relationship between two or more people or entitites.

Though there can be many privities of contract, *there can only be one privity of estate*
* A lessor remains in privity of contract with the landlord even if they sublease to a new tenant
	* Unless the landlord expressly releases the original tenant from this obligation
* An assignee or sublessee is not in privity of contract with a landlord until they explicitly assume the obligations of the original lease

Obligations that "touch and concern the land" transfer with privity of estate
* Consider a lease wherein a tenant agrees to take on rent, repair costs, snow removal, groundskeeping, and provide childcare for the landlord. If this lessee then subleases (and thus transfers privity of estate), then:
	* rent and repair costs would transfer, because they touch anc concern the land
	* snow removal and groundskeeping costs may transfer, though there's room for argument in either direction
	* childcare obligations/costs would not transfer, because they were purely contractual and did not concern the land

Any cause of action must hinge on either privity of contract or privity of estate, see [[Ernst v. Conditt]]

### Delivery of Possession

See: [[Hannan v. Dusch]]

The *implied covenant of delivery* holds that a landlord must deliver the legal right to possess the leased premises to the tenant. The tenant may waive this right.
* The American (Minority) Rule says that unless otherwise expressly stated, the landlord has no obligation to deliver physical possession to the lessee (i.e., if there are squatters on the property, the lessee has the legal right to seek their removal, but dealing with this is their problem rather than the landlord's)
	* Tenant acquires the right to evict with their lease.
	* The landlord is not liable for the tortious acts of the holdover/squatters.
	* Tenant can negotiate to add an express covenant to require delivery of physical possession if that is important to her.
* The English (Majority) Rule says that every lease has an implied covenant that the landord will deliver physical possession of the property the day the lease begins
	* The intent of the parties is prioritized here.
	* The new tenant was looking for a place to live.
	* The landlord is in a better position to know about the existence of holdover tenants.

### Sublease and Assignments
See: [[Ernst v. Conditt]]

A *sublease* conveys less than the entire remaining interest to the sublessee.
* Sublessees are *not in privity of estate* with their landlords
* Sublessees are only liable to the sublessor for performance of the sublease, and their right to possession hinges on the sublessor not defaulting on the master lease

An *assignment* conveys the entire remaining interest to the assignee.
* Assignees are in privity of estate with their landlords

Is it a sublease or is it an assignment?
* Old Rule: What was written the lease document?
* Modern Rule: What intent did the parties demonstrate via their actions?
* General Rule: If the terms of the agreement change, it is probably a sublease rather than an assignment.

### Lessor's Approval
See: [[Kendall v. Ernest Pestana]]

A lease may restrict a lessee's ability to sublease, hinging it on landlord approval.
* Old Rule: Landlords may withhold consent for any reason if the lease requires their consent
* Modern Rule: In commercial leases, the landlord cannot deny consent for reasons that constitute unlawful discrimination or for reasons that are not commercially relevant.
	* The objective test for commercial relevance:
		* financial responsibility of the sublessee
		* legality of the sublessee's proposed use
		* whether the sublessee will need to alter the premises for their proposed use
		* suitability of the use for the particular property
			* For example, a tattoo parlor can be commercially unreasonable in the context of a shopping mall because it could negatively impact surrounding businesses
			* This example may be a bit dated due to changing social norms. Other examples may include headshops or marijuana dispensaries.

## Rights, duties, and remedies of landlords and tenants
### Landlord's Remedies

**Default by Tenant**, see [[Berg v. Wiley]]
* Old Rule: When a tenant defaults on a lease but remains in possession of the premises, the landlord was legally entitled to peacibly reposess the premises himself.
	* The tenant could then sue if the eviction was wrongful
* Modern Rule: When a tenant defaults on a lease but remains in possession of the premises, a landlord cannot use self-help to evict them; the landlord must rely on legal remedies
	* This rule helps to avoid violence
* Remedies available to the landlord:
	* *Suit in ejectment*
	* *Summary proceedings*

**Abandonment by Tenant**, see [[Somer v. Kridel]]

The landlord has a duty to mitigate damages if the tenant abandons the leased property.
* This is an example of the influence of contract law.
* The landlord must take reasonable steps to mitigate and cannot treat the abandoned property differently than other properties he is trying to lease
* This burden is on the landlord because he is in the better position both to mitigate  the damages and to evidence effort taken to mitigate the damages.
* Once the property is relet, the tenants duty ends (and their damages are capped).
* Remedies available to the landlord:
	* *Terminate Lease*: the tenant is left liable for rent accrued and damages caused by abandonment
	* *Do Nothing*: but still has a duty to mitigate
	* *Lease-Based Measures*: when writing the lease, the following mechanisms are available:
		* *Rent Acceleration Clauses* - make the whole rent due upon default
		* *Security Deposits* - which are really supposed to be held in escrow and returned with interest, but whatever
		* *Payment characterized as a bonus* - front-load the rent (i.e., first & last)
		* *Liquidated Damages Provision* - agree upon a predetermined sum to be paid in the event of breach.
			* These are only enforceable if they take the form of damages rather than a penalty

### Landlord's Obligations
See: [[Village Commons v. Marion County Prosecutor's Office]]

**Quiet Enjoyment**
* Residential leases contain an express or implied *covenant of quiet enjoyment*. This means that neither the landlord nor persons acting as an agent of the landlord will interfere with the tenant's possession of the property
* Commercial leases also contain an express or implied *covenant of quiet enjoyment*, but it is generally only breached when the landlord's conduct has the effect of depriving the lessee of the beneficial use of the deprived premises.
* Remedies available to the tenant:
	* *Constructive Eviction* - the landlord creates a situation in which the tenant is forced to abandon the premises (due to inutility either in full or in part)
		* This requires a substantial interference with the tenant's quiet enjoyment.
			* The purposes for which the premises were leased are substantially frustrated
				* This will raise questions of foreseeability, the nature and degree of the harm, and the availability of other means to abate the interference or harm.
			* This frustration resulted naturally and probably from the landlord's actions or inactions
				* The landlord must have notice of the issue and a reasonable chance to fix it. 
			* And the breach of quiet enjoyment causes the tenant to actually vacate the premises.
				* Though the Restatement and some jurisdictions reject this requirement.
		* **NOTE**: An instruction by the landlord to stop using the property (either in whole or in part) amounts to an actual eviction.
	* *Rent Withholding* - based on the theory of dependent covenants, if a landlord has breached his covenant of quiet enjoyment, the tenant is not under the obligation to uphold her covenant to pay rent.
		* The safest way to do this is to pay rent in escrow. Should the landlord be found not to have breached, the tenant is on the hook for the withheld rent.

**Implied Warranty of Habitability**
* Residential leases are subject to an implied waranty of habitability. The landlord is obligated to deliver and maintain premises that are safe, clean, and fit for human habitation, see [[Hilder v. St. Peter]].
	* This warranty cannot be waived.
	* Tenant does not need to vacate the premises to claim violation of the implied waranty of habitability.
* Commercial leases are, in a few jurisdictions, subject to an implied waranty of fitness. They are not subject to the implied warranty of habitability.
	* The implied warranty of fitness has higher standards for proof of breach than that of habitability. 
* Remedies available to the tenant:
	* *Termination of the Lease*
	* *Stay and...*
		* *repair* - the tenant may remain in possession of the premises and reallocate a reasonable portion of their rent to use toward making necessary repairs.
		* *recover damages* - the tenant may stay in possession of the premises and recover damages in the form of rent abatement or deductions
			* Damages are measured by:
				* Agreed-upon rent minus the fair market value with defect
					* the easiest to compute, so the most often relied upon
				* As warranted value minus the fair market value with defect
					* this requires a market study, so is more costly/difficult
				* Fair market value of comparable units
		* *defend* - breach of the implied warranty of habitability is a defense against eviction
		* *seek punitive damages* - if the breach involved willful, wanton, or fraudulent conduct, the tenant may also seek punitive damages from the landlord.
* Policy Considerations
	* The implied warranty of habitability seeks to improve the standard of living for low-income tenants, but it also raises the cost of maintaining property for landlords, which may in turn cause them to raise rent or to stop investing in housing for low income individuals.
	* Other options available to address this issue include rent control and housing subsidies.
