# Estates in Land
## Freehold estates
Freehold estates are rights of conveyable exclusive possession and use. They have immobility and indeterminate duration.

### Fee Simple
Fee simple estates have several forms:
* **Fee Simple Absolute** - full ownership of the land
	* "To A and her heirs"
	* No reverter, because no one has a future interest
* **Fee Simple Determinable** - full ownership, with condition attached
	* "To A and her heirs so long as..."
	* Automatic reverter when the condition is met
* **Fee Simple on a Condition Subsequent** - full ownership, with condition attached as an option
	* "To A and her heirs so long as X, but if X occurs, grantor has the right of reentry"
	* Possible reverter when the conditio nis met if the grantor chooses to exercise it
* **Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation**
	* "To A, but if A [marries outside of religion], to B"
	* Automatic divestment in favor of a third party

### Fee Tale
Fee tale estates are inalienable rights of inheritance for the duration of a family line
* "To A and the heirs of his body"
* Automatically reverts when A's lineage dies out. No alienation

### Life Estate
A life estate expires on the death of a certain person (usually the holder of the estate)
* "To A for life"
* Reverter when A dies. Alienable, but subsequent grantor is subject to the same reverter when A dies.
