# Land Use Controls

## Judicial controls: nuisance

**Nuisance Test**
The actions of a party are regarded as a nuisance if they are:
	* intentional and reckless conduct; or
	* unintentional conduct that is either negligent, reckless, or inherently dangerous ^cbe078

### Types of nuisance
* **Public Nuisance** - something that fails [[#^cbe078| the nuisance test]] in such a way that it affects rights held in common by everyone
* **Private Nuisance** - something that fails [[#^cbe078| the nuisance test]] in such a way that it affects the rights of a particular party
	* In order to persue litigation, you must have suffered *special injury* as a result of the nuisance, where *special injury* is some particularized and personalized injury greater than a member of the general public

**Intentional nuisance**
The individual causing the nuisance either:
* acts for the purpose of causing the nuisance;
* knows the nuisance is a result of his conduct; or
* knows that a nuisance is substantially certain to result from his conduct.

A **nuisance per se** is an act or structure that is always a nuisance.
A **nuisance per accidens** is a nuisance by virtue of its context (e.g., location, manner of operation)

### Is there a nuisance?
* Does the plaintiff have a possessory interest in land?
	* If yes: continue
	* If no: [[#^c76bb4|sorry, you lose]]
* Has the defendant substantially interfered with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of their property?
	* If yes: continue
	* If no: [[#^c76bb4|sorry, you lose]]
* Is the interference unreasonable?
	* If yes: winner!
	* If no: [[#^c76bb4|sorry, you lose]]

Endings:

It's a nuisance!

It's not a nuisance! ^c76bb4

**Behavioral tests**
* **Substantial interference** - a threshold test; if interference causes substantial harm, courts may opt not to perform a balancing test that takes the defendant's interests into account
	* Especially sensitive individuals have no augmented power to claim nuisance (e.g., if you are a very light sleeper, the threshold of tolerable noise is legally the same for you as anyone else)
* **Cost-benefit balancing test** - balance between parties' intersts to test reasonableness
	* Who is harming whom more? What parties would a remedy harm?

### Results and Remedies
**No Nuisance**
* The use is protected by a property right and will continue
	* The nuisance will continue *unless* the parties can bargain for the sale of the right of their own free will

**Nuisance - Enjoin**
* The use is found to be a nuisance and it is enjoined from continuing
	* The plaintiff's use is protected by a property rule
	* The nuisance will continue *if and only if* parties can bargain for the sale of the right of their own free will

**Nuisance - Damages**
* The attacked use is found to be a nuisance, but it is allowed to continue given the defendant pays the plaintiff damages.
	* This has the effect of giving the plaintiff protection from the attacked use but forcing a sale of that right to the defendant
* Courts avoid granting injunctions when the value of the activity is greater than the harm done to the plaintiff

**Nuisance - Enjoy & Damages**
* The attacked use is found to be a nuisance, so it is enjoined. However, the plaintiff is required to pay damages to compensate the defendant for their discontinued use.
	* Here, the attacked use gets *liability rule protection*
	* This has the effect of giving the defendant the right to the attacked use but forcing a sale of that right to the plaintiff

**Coming to the nuisance**
* When a plaintiff is suffering a nuisance because they came to it, they are barred from relief
* When slow development over time brings a community in the viscinity of a nuisance, relief may be granted, see [[Del Webb]]

**NOTE**: permanent damages for nuisance run with the land. Subsequent owners will not be compensated for the nuisance, as it is expected to be reflected in the sale price of the property

## Private controls: easements, covenants, and servitudes

### Servitudes
* **Covenants**: A servitude that runs with the land and consists of a promise that a landowner will use his own land (or not use his own land) in a specified manner
	* Can take the form of a **real covenant** or of an **equitable servitude**
* **Easements and Profits**: A servitude that give a person the right to use someone else's land in a specific and limited manner
	* **Easement**: A pure use right.
		* Can be *appurtenant* or *in gross* ([[#Easements|see more below]])
		* *Licenses* are a form of easement
	* **Profit**: A servitude that gives the holder the right to take something valuable from someone else's land that is a part or product of the land
		* An easement to enter the land is implied when a profit is granted
		* Nontransferrable; does not run with the land

#### Licenses
Licenses give perission to do some act on another person's land that would otherwise be a trespass. Licenses are revocable except in cases of estoppel. They are presumed to be personal (non-transferrable) by default, but parties are free to bargain around this.

**Estoppel** ^0b6c18
* A license is held to be irrevocable by estoppel if
	* the licensee has constructed substantial improvements 
	* to either the licensor's or 
	* the licensee's land 
	* in reliance on the license
* Irrevocability will last for
	* whatever time is necessary to enable the licensee to reap the benefit of his expenditures;
	* the life of the pertinent structure; or
	* forever
* Licenses are only ever made irrevocable as a remedy; calling a license irrevocable when creating it is not legally binding absent the necessary conditions for estoppel

#### Easements

An easement is a grant of an interest in land that entitles a person to use land possessed by another.

**Affirmative or Negative**
* **Affirmative Easement** - the owner of an affirmative easement has the right to go onto the servient land and do some act on the land
* **Negative Easement** - the owner of a negative easement can prevent the owner of the servient land from doing some act on the servient land
	* For example, from building in such a way that would block your view
	
**Appurtenant or In Gross**
* **Easement appurtenant** - (runs with the land) an easement for the use of another's land (servient tenement) for benefit of use and enjoyment of the easement owner's own land (dominant tenement) 
	* This easement attaches to the dominant land; its benefit transfers with the dominant land, and its burden transfers with the servient land
	* Regardless of what deeds or contracts may otherwise stipualte, these always run with the land
* **Easement in gross** - (runs with the person) an easement that does not benefit its owner in the use and enjoyment of her own land, but merely gives her the right to use the servient land
	* These can be assigned

**NOTE**: Licenses can be issued orally; easements cannot

**Creating an easement**
* *expressed grant*
	* written instrument signed by grantor -> easement (subject to Statute of Frauds)
	* oral permission to enter land -> license
* *expressed reservation/exception*
	* If a grantor conveys land reserving/excepting an easement, the land conveyed is the servient tenement
	* majority rule: easements cannot be reserved in favor of a third party
		* but, a covenant can be created for the benefit of a third party in a common interest community
	* minority rule: easement can be reserved in favor of a third party
		* to prevent unjust enrichment
* *implied from existing use (quasi-easement)*
	* if a common owner uses some part of land for the benefit of the other and then divide it
		* Prior use must have been reasonably necessary for use and enjoyment of the quasi-dominant tenement
		* The prior use must be continuous
		* The use must be in existence at the time of the division of the property
		* The parties must intend, at division, to continue the use
		* At division, the use must also be apparent
	* an easement implied from existing use may continue forever, even after the element of necessity disappears
* *license made irrevocable by estoppel*
	* [[#^0b6c18|see above]]
* *implied from necessity*
	* The owner of a tract of land divides the tract, thus rendering one lot inaccessible to a public road or utility line
	* Implied only over the land-lock*ing* parcel
	* A common grantor of the dominant and servient tenements is required
* *by prescription* ^4e58e0
	* Similar to [[Possession and Property#Adverse Possession|adverse possession]]; requires:
		* Open and notorious use
		* Adverse and under a claim of right
		* Continuous use
		* Uninterrupted use

**Terminating an easement**
* *by unity of title*
	* the title to both tracts of land come to be owned by the same owner
* *by act of the dominant owner*
	* *release* - dominant owner releases the easement to the servient owner via a written instrument that satisfies the Statute of Frauds
	* *abandonment* - acts that constitute an unequivocal intent to abandon the easement
		* can include oral release or non-use coupled with a failure to maintain the easement;
		* permitting the easement to be blocked by others; or
		* establishing a substitute easement elsewhere
* *alteration of dominant tenement*
	* if an easement is granted for a particular purpose, and an alteration makes it impossible to acheive that purpose, the easement is extinguished
* *easement by necessity*
	* terminates along with the necessity
* *destruction of servient tenement*
	* An easement in a structure is terminated if the structure is destroyed without the fault of the owner of the servient estate
	* If the structure is destroyed by the intentional act of the servient owner, the easment is not extinguished and the owner is liable for damages to the easement holder
* *prescription of servient tenement*
	* If the servient owner interferes with an easement in an adverse manner, the servient owner can extinguish the easement by prescription using [[#^4e58e0| the same requirements for the creation of an easement by prescription]]

#### Real Covenants

Real covenants are covenants that run with the land *at law*, so plaintiffs, when suing for breach, must satisfy the requirements for the covenant to run at law.

Real covenants must be in writing; they cannot be implied or acquired by prescription.
* Most are only signed by the grantor, and by accepting the covenant (usually in the deed), the grantee agrees to be bound as the promisor

**Affirmative covenant** - promise to do something on the land
**Negative covenant** - promise not to do something on the land

**Enforcement by or against successors in interest**
In order to show the **burden** of the covenant runs with the estate, one must prove:
* *Intent* - the original parties must have intended the burden to run
* *Touch and Concern* - the substance of the promise must touch and concern both the burdened and benefited land. This means that the promise must affect the use and enjoyment of land or must affect the advantages and burdens of land ownership
*  *Veritical Privity* - all courts require vertical privity of estate between the original promisor and the successor to the burdened estate
	* Generally satisfied when the successor acquires an estate of at least the same duration as the original promisor
	* Vertical privity applies to *estates* in land, not to the land itself. Therefore, the burden of a real covenant does not run to an [[Possession and Property#Adverse Possession| adverse possesor]].
* *Horizontal Privity* - (depricated) the older, now disfavored view of real covenants required horizontal privity of estate between the original parties
	* This is not established by tenurial interests (leases)
	* Generally satisfied whenever the two original parties have either
		* a preexisting mutual interest in each other's estates; or
		* the real covenant is created in the instrument by which one owner transfers title to the other owner

**NOTE**: Privity is only created through land transactions, not through promises. In order for there to be horizontal privity, a covenant must be made *at the same time* as the conveyance or via a straw conveyance.
* In a straw conveyance, a third party receives both properties and immediately re-conveys them with the covenants attached in order to ensure the restriction is placed on the chain of title

In order to show the **benefit** of the covenant runs with the estate, one must prove:
* *Intent*
* *Vertical Privity* - most courts require privity of estate between the original promisor and the successor to the benefited estate, but privity is satisfied so long as the successor acquires some interest in the originally benefited estate
* *Touch and Concern* - though this requirement is breaking down both by statute and judicial opinions

The standard to prove benefit is lower.

#### Equitable Servitudes
Equitable servitudes are promises made comprising the elements below. They are very similar in practice to real covenants, with the distinction of remedies available in the event of breach.

**Elements**
* Intent to bind successors
* Touch and concern the land
* Notice to purchaser of burdened property
	* Either actual or constructive (from chain of title)
* **NOTE**: There is no privity requirement for equitable servitudes

#### Real covenant or equitable servitude?
The two are basically the same thing, with the key distinction of what remedies are available to each, and what analysis a court applies when evaluating whether to award that remedy. Real covenants have remedies at law; equitable servitudes have remidies in equity.
* For money damages, use the real covenant analysis
* For an injunction, consider whether the requirements of an equitable servitude have been met

#### Reciprocal Negative Easements
A reciprocal negative easement can be created by implication from a general plan of development of a residential subdivision (in the majority of states)
* If a common owner sells one lot with restrictions that benefit the land retained, the reciprocal negative easement is "fastened onto" lots still held by the common owner

#### Termination of Restrictive Covenants and Equitable Servitudes
* *Unreasonable restraint on alienation* - if enforcing the covenant would result in this, a court is unlikely to enforce it
* *Merger of benefited and burdened estates*
* *Expiration of the covenant* - by its own terms
* *Release* - all owners of a benefited property can grant a written release to the owner of the burdened estate. Release must be in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds (but if they fail to do so, they may still be estopped from later denying it)
* *Changed conditions* - if conditions within the area affected by the servitude have so radically and thoroughly changed that the servitude cannot accomplish its purpose, it will be extinguished. In this case *all* of the benefited land must have lost its benefit
* *Unclean hands* - the owner of benefited property seeking to enforce a common burden that he himself has violated
* *Abandonment* - a collective version of unclean hands. When a servitude is frequently and persistently violated without enforcement, it may be treated as abandoned by the benefit holders
* *Acquiescence* - usually only found when owner of benefited property endures multiple violations but then tries to enforce the covenant selectively against one owner
* *Equitable Estoppel* - if the party seeking an equitable servitude has knowingly lied to a defendant ignorant of the true facts, intending to actually induce reliance on the lie, he will be estopped from enforcing the servitude
* *Laches* - unreasonable delay in enforcing an equitable servitude when coupled with some resulting prejudice to the defendant will bar enforcement (rare)
* *Eminent Domain* - the parcel of land is condemned

### Common Interest Communities

A common interest community is a development mixing common and developer ownership with covenants, conditions, and restrictions, through which owners are legally bound to their neighbors. Governments incentivize these, because they shift the cost of maintaining infrastructure to developers.

For covenants to run with subsequent owners, there must be
* *Privity*
* *Intent*
* *Touch and concern the land* - here, they do not necessarily need to touch and concern the land in the traditional sense, but can instead touch and concern the land in other meaningful ways (e.g., maitenance of common areas)

Homeowners in common interest communities are automatically members of homeowners associations, which enforce the servitudes set forth in the declaration establishing the common interest communities.
* **HOAs are shadow governments with no limitation and little accountability**

**Types of common intereste communities**
Though about one sixth of all Americans live in common interest communities (think coops, condos, subdivizions, etc.), they tend to be exclusionary.
* *Condominiums*
	* Each unit is owned separately in fee simple, and all public areas including the land beneath are owned by unit owners as tenants in common
	* Each owner is liable for a monthly charge to maintain common facilities and insure against casualty and liability
	* Declaration of condominium provides for an association of unit owners to make and enforce rules
* *Cooperatives*
	* The title to the land and building is held by a corporation in which the residents all hold shares. The residents control it through an elected board of directors.
	* Each resident also has a long-term renewable lease of an apartment unit, thus each is both a tenant and an owner
	* Cooperatives have *one blanket mortgage for the whole building*, so if one co-operator fails to pay his share, the others are liable to make it up
	* Because of this, coops have strict screening and are very exclusive
	* Mostly found in New York City

**Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions**
* *In the master deed* - enforced as real covenants, equitable servitudes, or servitudes
	* strong presumption in favor of validity; very strong standard for "unreasonable"
* *In HOA bylaws* - enforced as real covenants, equitable servitudes, or servitudes
	* strong presumption in favor of validity; lower bar for "unreasonable" than for those in the master deed, but still a high bar
* *In cooperative apartments* - courts will usually defer to the "business judgement" of the directors of the corporation

Covenants, conditions, and restrictions can restrict all manner of things, including things that a municipality cannot. This is justified by "protecting real estate values".
* Some common examples include: color of exterior of house, landscaping, satellite dishes, children’s play equipment, parking in driveway, RVs/trailers, color of car, garage door closed, car work in driveway, color of drapes, no pickup trucks, no signs, pets, minimum age, no children, political signs

A servitude is not too unreasonable to be enforced unless:
* it is wholly arbitrary;
* it violates a fundamental public policy; or
* it imposes a burden on the use of the affected land that outweighs any benefit
	* Here, the restrictions will be assessed through reference to damage to the whole community rather than any individual

## Legislative controls: zoning

Zoning, occasionally called [[Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.|Euclidian zoning]], is constitutional under the police powers of the state. Zoning is a subcategory of legislative regulation.

Zoning ordinances benefit from presumptive validity. They are analyzed under rational basis scrutiny, unless a constitutional right is violated by the zoning ordinance, in which case they are analyzed under strict scrutiny.

### Non-conforming Use
Zoning usually acts upon preexisting uses, which often do not fit the new requirements.

Uses may not be banned outright, but they may be restricted in proximity from other uses (e.g., a sex shop and an elementary school).

Uses that do not conform to zoning restrictions run with the land, because they are assumed to be part of the value of the property

**Amortization**
Amortization in property serves as a work-around for zoning out certain uses. It imagines a fixed value of a non-conforming use that is recovered over time. This doctrine assumes that compliant use is not possible, but non-conforming users are entitled to some length of time to earn back what they have invested into the propety before finding somewhere else to do it.

Amortization is valid in many states. Factors considered when testing its reasonableness include:
* Length of amortization period granted
* Amount invested in property
* Amount of time needed to recoup the investment
* Number of improvements made by the non-conforming user
* Public detriment caused by the non-conforming use
* Character of surrounding neighborhood


### Variances and Special Exceptions
Two requirements for granting a variance:
* *Undue hardship* (a lax standard)
	* Problem must not be one of the sufferers’ own creation
    * Also, owner must take steps to try to make conformity possible
* Public good and intent of zoning plan – *proposed variance won’t be detrimental to the neighborhood*
	*  If you can show this, a good chance of getting variance
	* Refers to the purpose of zoning (air, light, open-space) and to a possible decline in surrounding property values 
	* Objections of neighbors are important – board usually won’t grant a variance if anyone objects in order to avoid litigation

### Exclusionary Zoning
Communities can use exclusionary zoning to define what kind of people they want in their community
* Often regarded as “keeping minorities out,” but can also be motivated by fiscal concerns such as property tax revenue
* For example, a town may want to discourage families with many children from moving within its limits, because then it becomes responsible for the education of those children
	* It cannot ban children outright, but it can do things like restrict the number of bedrooms per unit in new rental complexes, limit number of rental units in general, etc.
	* Low income families, particularly low income families of color, are more likely to have many children than upper class white families
* Accordingly, policy that is dressed up in financial motivations can have discriminatory effects

## Physical and regulatory takings
**NOTE**: Takings will not be covered on this exam

### Eminent domain
In short, the government can lawfully seize private property so long as it compensates you "justly" for it, and there is an anticipated public benefit to its reallocation, see [[Kelo v. City of New London]]
