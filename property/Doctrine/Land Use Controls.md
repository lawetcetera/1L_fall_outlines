# Land Use Controls

## Judicial controls: nuisance

**Nuisance Test**
The actions of a party are regarded as a nuisance if they are:
	* intentional and reckless conduct; or
	* unintentional conduct that is either negligent, reckless, or inherently dangerous ^cbe078

### Types of nuisance
* **Public Nuisance** - something that fails [[#^cbe078| the nuisance test]] in such a way that it affects rights held in common by everyone
* **Private Nuisance** - something that fails [[#^cbe078| the nuisance test]] in such a way that it affects the rights of a particular party
	* In order to persue litigation, you must have suffered *special injury* as a result of the nuisance, where *special injury* is some particularized and personalized injury greater than a member of the general public

**Intentional nuisance**
The individual causing the nuisance either:
* acts for the purpose of causing the nuisance;
* knows the nuisance is a result of his conduct; or
* knows that a nuisance is substantially certain to result from his conduct.

A **nuisance per se** is an act or structure that is always a nuisance.
A **nuisance per accidens** is a nuisance by virtue of its context (e.g., location, manner of operation)

### Is there a nuisance?
* Does the plaintiff have a possessory interest in land?
	* If yes: continue
	* If no: [[#^c76bb4|sorry, you lose]]
* Has the defendant substantially interfered with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of their property?
	* If yes: continue
	* If no: [[#^c76bb4|sorry, you lose]]
* Is the interference unreasonable?
	* If yes: winner!
	* If no: [[#^c76bb4|sorry, you lose]]

Endings:

It's a nuisance!

It's not a nuisance! ^c76bb4

**Behavioral tests**
* **Substantial interference** - a threshold test; if interference causes substantial harm, courts may opt not to perform a balancing test that takes the defendant's interests into account
	* Especially sensitive individuals have no augmented power to claim nuisance (e.g., if you are a very light sleeper, the threshold of tolerable noise is legally the same for you as anyone else)
* **Cost-benefit balancing test** - balance between parties' intersts to test reasonableness
	* Who is harming whom more? What parties would a remedy harm?

### Results and Remedies
**No Nuisance**
* The use is protected by a property right and will continue
	* The nuisance will continue *unless* the parties can bargain for the sale of the right of their own free will

**Nuisance - Enjoin**
* The use is found to be a nuisance and it is enjoined from continuing
	* The plaintiff's use is protected by a property rule
	* The nuisance will continue *if and only if* parties can bargain for the sale of the right of their own free will

**Nuisance - Damages**
* The attacked use is found to be a nuisance, but it is allowed to continue given the defendant pays the plaintiff damages.
	* This has the effect of giving the plaintiff protection from the attacked use but forcing a sale of that right to the defendant
* Courts avoid granting injunctions when the value of the activity is greater than the harm done to the plaintiff

**Nuisance - Enjoy & Damages**
* The attacked use is found to be a nuisance, so it is enjoined. However, the plaintiff is required to pay damages to compensate the defendant for their discontinued use.
	* Here, the attacked use gets *liability rule protection*
	* This has the effect of giving the defendant the right to the attacked use but forcing a sale of that right to the plaintiff

**Coming to the nuisance**
* When a plaintiff is suffering a nuisance because they came to it, they are barred from relief
* When slow development over time brings a community in the viscinity of a nuisance, relief may be granted, see [[Del Webb]]

**NOTE**: permanent damages for nuisance run with the land. Subsequent owners will not be compensated for the nuisance, as it is expected to be reflected in the sale price of the property

## Private controls: easements, covenants, and servitudes

### Servitudes
* **Covenants**: A servitude that runs with the land and consists of a promise that a landowner will use his own land (or not use his own land) in a specified manner
	* Can take the form of a **real covenant** or of an **equitable servitude**
* **Easements and Profits**: A servitude that give a person the right to use someone else's land in a specific and limited manner
	* **Easement**: A pure use right.
		* Can be *appurtenant* or *in gross* ([[#Easements|see more below]])
		* *Licenses* are a form of easement
	* **Profit**: A servitude that gives the holder the right to take something valuable from someone else's land that is a part or product of the land
		* An easement to enter the land is implied when a profit is granted
		* Nontransferrable; does not run with the land

#### Licenses
Licenses give perission to do some act on another person's land that would otherwise be a trespass. Licenses are revocable except in cases of estoppel. They are presumed to be personal (non-transferrable) by default, but parties are free to bargain around this.

**Estoppel** ^0b6c18
* A license is held to be irrevocable by estoppel if
	* the licensee has constructed substantial improvements 
	* to either the licensor's or 
	* the licensee's land 
	* in reliance on the license
* Irrevocability will last for
	* whatever time is necessary to enable the licensee to reap the benefit of his expenditures;
	* the life of the pertinent structure; or
	* forever
* Licenses are only ever made irrevocable as a remedy; calling a license irrevocable when creating it is not legally binding absent the necessary conditions for estoppel

#### Easements

An easement is a grant of an interest in land that entitles a person to use land possessed by another.

**Affirmative or Negative**
* **Affirmative Easement** - the owner of an affirmative easement has the right to go onto the servient land and do some act on the land
* **Negative Easement** - the owner of a negative easement can prevent the owner of the servient land from doing some act on the servient land
	* For example, from building in such a way that would block your view
	
**Appurtenant or In Gross**
* **Easement appurtenant** - (runs with the land) an easement for the use of another's land (servient tenement) for benefit of use and enjoyment of the easement owner's own land (dominant tenement) 
	* This easement attaches to the dominant land; its benefit transfers with the dominant land, and its burden transfers with the servient land
	* Regardless of what deeds or contracts may otherwise stipualte, these always run with the land
* **Easement in gross** - (runs with the person) an easement that does not benefit its owner in the use and enjoyment of her own land, but merely gives her the right to use the servient land
	* These can be assigned

**NOTE**: Licenses can be issued orally; easements cannot

**Creating an easement**
* *expressed grant*
	* written instrument signed by grantor -> easement (subject to Statute of Frauds)
	* oral permission to enter land -> license
* *expressed reservation/exception*
	* If a grantor conveys land reserving/excepting an easement, the land conveyed is the servient tenement
	* majority rule: easements cannot be reserved in favor of a third party
		* but, a covenant can be created for the benefit of a third party in a common interest community
	* minority rule: easement can be reserved in favor of a third party
		* to prevent unjust enrichment
* *implied from existing use (quasi-easement)*
	* if a common owner uses some part of land for the benefit of the other and then divide it
		* Prior use must have been reasonably necessary for use and enjoyment of the quasi-dominant tenement
		* The prior use must be continuous
		* The use must be in existence at the time of the division of the property
		* The parties must intend, at division, to continue the use
		* At division, the use must also be apparent
	* an easement implied from existing use may continue forever, even after the element of necessity disappears
* *license made irrevocable by estoppel*
	* [[#^0b6c18|see above]]
* *implied from necessity*
	* The owner of a tract of land divides the tract, thus rendering one lot inaccessible to a public road or utility line
	* Implied only over the land-lock*ing* parcel
	* A common grantor of the dominant and servient tenements is required
* *by prescription* ^4e58e0
	* Similar to [[Possession and Property#Adverse Possession|adverse possession]]; requires:
		* Open and notorious use
		* Adverse and under a claim of right
		* Continuous use
		* Uninterrupted use

**Terminating an easement**
* *by unity of title*
	* the title to both tracts of land come to be owned by the same owner
* *by act of the dominant owner*
	* *release* - dominant owner releases the easement to the servient owner via a written instrument that satisfies the Statute of Frauds
	* *abandonment* - acts that constitute an unequivocal intent to abandon the easement
		* can include oral release or non-use coupled with a failure to maintain the easement;
		* permitting the easement to be blocked by others; or
		* establishing a substitute easement elsewhere
* *alteration of dominant tenement*
	* if an easement is granted for a particular purpose, and an alteration makes it impossible to acheive that purpose, the easement is extinguished
* *easement by necessity*
	* terminates along with the necessity
* *destruction of servient tenement*
	* An easement in a structure is terminated if the structure is destroyed without the fault of the owner of the servient estate
	* If the structure is destroyed by the intentional act of the servient owner, the easment is not extinguished and the owner is liable for damages to the easement holder
* *prescription of servient tenement*
	* If the servient owner interferes with an easement in an adverse manner, the servient owner can extinguish the easement by prescription using [[#^4e58e0| the same requirements for the creation of an easement by prescription]]

#### Real Covenants

Real covenants are covenants that run with the land *at law*, so plaintiffs, when suing for breach, must satisfy the requirements for the covenant to run at law

**Affirmative covenant** - promise to do something on the land
**Negative covenant** - promise not to do something on the land

**Enforcement by or against successors in interest**



#### Equitable Servitudes
Equitable servitudes are promises made that 

### Real covenant or equitable servitude?
The two are basically the same thing, with the key distinction of what remedies are available to each, and what analysis a court applies when evaluating whether to award that remedy.
* For money damages, use the real covenant analysis
* For an injunction, consider whether the requirements of an equitable servitude have been met

### Common Interest Communities

***

## Legislative controls: zoning

Zoning, occasionally called [[Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.|Euclidian zoning]], is constitutional under the police powers of the state. Zoning is a subcategory of legislative regulation.

### Non-conforming Use


### Variances and Special Exceptions

### Aesthetic Regulation

### Exclusionary Zoning

## Physical and regulatory takings
**NOTE**: Takings will not be covered on this exam

### Eminent domain
In short, the government can lawfully seize private property so long as it compensates you "justly" for it, and there is an anticipated public benefit to its reallocation, see [[Kelo v. City of New London]]
