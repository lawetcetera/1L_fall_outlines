# In Rem
An *in rem* lawsuit that adjudicates rights over a piece of property.

The lawsuit must be initiated in the state where the property sits.

1. A court "attaches" a piece of property "in" its geographic jurisdiction.
	* Remember, incorporeal property is treated as being "within" some jurisdiction.
	* The court "seizes" the property. If it is small enough (e.g., jewelry), it might go in a vault. If it is not (e.g., land), it will post public notice.
2. Court then adjudicates ownership over this property as to the whole world
	* "In re \<PROPERTY\>" as title of suit

Outcome: Claimant claims some ownership interest in the property (e.g., a lien on a house)

## When would you want to bring a suit *in rem*?

Suppose an individual hires a general contractor to rennovate a house. The general contractor hires a subcontractor. The general contractor is paid, but gambles away all of his money before paying the sub. The subcontractor can then bring a suit *in rem* against the house to induce either payment by the owners or liquidation of the house by the state.
* This happens because the court subscribes to the idea that the mixing of labor and land produces a property interest in that land.
