# Personal Jurisdiction

Personal Jurisdiction deals with the power of a court to exercise control over a particular person or item of property. Personal jurisdiction is governed by the 5th Ammendment right to due process and [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4| FRCP 4(k)(1)]]

**NOTE**: Personal Jurisdiction can be waived.

## Policy Considerations
* The court in which a case is litigated ought to bear some relevance to the event(s) that occurred or the people involved in them.
* Should a damages award require the liquidation of property by the state, only the state in which the property lies ought to be able to seize it in order to prevent conflict between states. Agents (police) of one state do not have authority in others.
* Especially in the modern era, most forms of wealth are held in some incorporeal form (e.g., bank accounts, securities). This system requires us to consider them as if they were within a given physical location.

## [[Pennoyer]] Theory of Jurisdiction
**NOTE**: deprecated.
**NOTE**: [[Pennoyer]] uses *in rem* when what it means really is what we refer to as *quasi in rem*.
* Every state has *absolute* sovereignty over the persons and property within its borders.
* Every state has *exclusive* sovereignty over the persons and property within its borders.
