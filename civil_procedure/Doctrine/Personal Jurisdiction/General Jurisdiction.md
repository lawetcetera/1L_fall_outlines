# General Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction is permissible even though there is no relationship between the subject matter of the litigation and the forum.

## Bases for *in personam* jurisdiction
### Really at home
* State in which a person is domiciled or in which a corporation is incorporated/its principal place of business
* No need for long-arm statute
### Daimler "at home"
* Long-arm statute, AND ^7fc8b7
	* State statute that empowers that state's courts to hear certain types of cases ^316f98
	* Can list specific circumstances, go to the limits of the constitution, or both
* Substantial, continuous, and systemic contacts
	* For buisnesses, location of place where some large fraction (>50%?) of its business takes place
### Consent
* Failure to object (quickly)
	* Plaintiffs consent by filing
	* Defendents can object by filing a [[Motion to Dismiss|motion to dismiss]].
* Advanced consent (e.g., forum selection clause)

### Tag?
It's unclear whether a tag is still sufficient to secure general jurisdiction, see [[Burnam]].

* Scalia believes that tags confer GJ.
* Brennan believes that an in jurisdiction tag is a relevant but not dispositive thing, that will fit into a broader analysis (e.g., evidence of minimal contacts)

#### Policy Considerations
* It used to be much more difficult to travel between states, so being tagged in a state seemed like a more reasonable justification for making you litigate in that state because you exercised significant effort in getting there and staying there.
