# Collateral Order Doctrine

The [[Cohen]] exception is an understanding of [[28 U.S.C. § 1291]]. Its doctrine holds that appeals from interlocutory rulings are okay so long as  those rulings conclusively decide an issue separate from the merits of the case and would be effectively unable to be reviewed after final judgment.

Some examples include:
-   Disclosure orders adverse to attorney-client privilege [[Mohawk Industries v. Carpenter]]
-   Order to disqualify a party's attorney [[Richardson-Merrell, Inc. v. Koller]]
-   Whether a defendant extradited to the United States was immune to civil process [[Van Cauwenberghe v. Baird]]
-   Whether a case should have been filed somewhere else in accordance with a contract [[Lauro Lines SRL v. Chasser]]
-   Order rejecting a party's claim to immunity from suit under a private settlement agreement [[Digital Equip Corp v Desktop Direct Inc]]
 - Order imposing sanctions for discovery violations on an attorney who no longer represented client [[Cunningham v. Hamilton County]]

## Requirements
1.  Raises an important issue that is collateral to the merits, 
	* Not an ingredient of the cause of action 
2.  Is effectively unreviewable at the end of the case,
	* Example: a bond, which after the end of the case will cost the full price of the loss 
	* Interpreted very narrowly – most issues will be reviewable later 
3.  Is non-discretionary, and 
4.  Was completely resolved by the court order in question (i.e. is final with respect to this issue) 
	* cause of action's judgment will conclusively determine the disputed question
