# Double Discretion

Double discretion is the doctrine of [[28 U.S.C. § 1292#b|28 U.S.C. § 1292(b)]], which  allows appeal of an interlocutory order if the trial judge certifies that it involves a controlling issue of law and that there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion. The Court of Appeals must also agree to hear the interlocutory appeal.
-   Essentially, it is a really important issue on which that court believes it needs an appellate ruling
    
## Requirements
Judges must state in writing that the following is true: 

1.  Controlling question of law to the case 
	-   Will make a material difference in the case
	-   Greiner’s model answer: no reason to grant review if there is 
		1.  Nothing special about the case, 
		2.  The choice of law issue is unlikely to recur, 
		3.  And the proceedings are not particularly high cost 
2.  Substantial ground for difference of opinion 
	-   Obvious answer = not a good candidate for appeal; must be a close, critical issue 
3.  Immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation 
	-   Has to make it so that we are going to adjudicate the case earlier 
	-   Resolution of that issue will materially increase likelihood of adjudication of dispute 
4.  Application must be made within 10 days after the entry of the order
	-   Clock starts ticking when judge writes letter
