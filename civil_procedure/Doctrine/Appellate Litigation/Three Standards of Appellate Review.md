# Three Standards of Appellate Review
In order to determine whether a mistake was made at the trial level, an appeals court will employ the following standards of review:
* ***de novo*** - the least deferential
	* Review this issue as if for the first time.
	* Used by an appellate court when reviewing a trial court's rulings on law
* **clearly erroneous** - some deference
	* used to review a trial judge's findings of fact
	* appellate judge affords the trial judge's decision some defference, but not unlimited
	* the decision is likely to be upheld if the appellate judge can so much as understand the reasoning of the trial judge, even if she disagrees with it
* **abuse of discretion** - some deference
	* used to review almost anything besides a finding of fact by the trial judge
		* e.g., you objected to evidence being admitted to the record but were overruled
	* functionally the same amount of deference as *clearly erroneous*
* **plain error** - most deferential
	* used when counsel argues on appeal that the trial judge made a mistake, but they failed to object to it/ask for it during trial
	* requires the error to be "screamingly obvious" for the appellate judge to find error
		* hardly ever happens

### If error is found
**Harmless Error Review**
Finding error does not automatically result in a reversal. The appeals court must go on to hold that the error with reasonable probability affected the outcome of the case. If the error is determined to have been harmless, the judgment is affirmed. ^e4f051
* Errors are almost always found to be harmless

**NOTE**: Courts can start on the assumption that there was an error, without holding that there was, and determine it would have been harmless were it to be there. They'll do that if this analysis is easier, which it almost always is.
