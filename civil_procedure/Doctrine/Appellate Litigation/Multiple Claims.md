# Multiple Claims

[[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 54#b| FRCP 54(b)]] is an interpretation of [[28 U.S.C. § 1291]] which allows for appeal to be taken from one or more final decisions on individual claims in an action containing multiple claims, without having to wait for final decisions to be rendered on all claims.

## Requirements
1. Multiple claims
	* here, "claim" means a single legal theory, possibly coupled with a set of legal facts
	* **NOTE**: this is a different definition of claim than is used for [[Claim Preclusion| preclusion purposes]].
2. The district court must make:
	1. an express determination that there is no just reason for delay; and
		* because there is a time limit for appeals, the magic words of "expressly determines" makes the clock start for the time limit during which a party may appeal
	2. an express direction for the entry of judgment
3. The claim must be separable from the rest of the claims.

### Example determination of "no just reason for delay"
See: [[Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. General Electric Co.]]
1. Fact that plaintiff's claim was large and liquidated
2. Difference between prejudgment and market interest rates would cause great hardship to plaintiff
3. Fact that pending counterclaims would not be decided for many months if not years

## Bases of Appeal 
1.  A standard appeal argument that court was wrong on law/facts of claim.
2. An argument that a judge erroneously held that claims entered on final judgment via 54(b) were sufficiently separable from the rest of the claims in the case 
	*  If the claims as to which the trial court has entered judgment are intertwined with claims still being litigated, appeal on basis that trial court abused their discretion for finding there is no just reason for delay (this is typically a factual intersection) 
		* The trial court's judgment gets vacated and the appeals court sends the issue back down
		* Trial court judge typically won’t change stance on it, but the entry of judgment is stayed until the entire trial concludes

**NOTE**: A counterclaim does not prevent leveraging [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 54#b| Rule 54(b)]], see [[Cold Metal Press Co.]]
