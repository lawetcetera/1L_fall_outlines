# Appellate Jurisdiction in General

An appeals court has an independent duty to notice a potential defect in its own appellate jurisdiction, *sua sponte*. If it finds such a defect, it must immediately dismiss the appeal and remand to the district court.

## Requirements for Appellate Jurisdiction
1. The District Court must have had [[Subject Matter Jurisdiction]].
2. The appellate court must have appellate jurisdiction granted by Congress, per the appellate jurisdiction statutes.

### Appellate Jurisdiction Statutes
**NOTE**: On an exam, address *all* of these.
* [[28 U.S.C. § 1291]] - [[FInal Orders after Judgment]] (*most common*), [[Multiple Claims]], [[Collateral Order Doctrine]]
* [[28 U.S.C. § 1292]] - [[Double Discretion]], [[Injunctions]]
* [[28 U.S.C. § 1651]] - [[Writs of Mandamus]]

## Goals of Appellate Review
* Correct errors by court of original jurisdiction 
* Develop a consistent body of law to be followed in future cases 
* Meet the public’s “demand for justice”, which assumes that important grievances will be heard and resolved by the highest possible governmental authority

## Finality Principle
In the federal court system, there is a strong presumption in favor of waiting until the end of a case before allowing an appeal. District Courts get law correct the vast majority of the time, and many times when they’re wrong it’s [[Three Standards of Appellate Review#^e4f051|harmless error]].
    
### Policy considerations
Advantages:
* Repeated interruptions & delays could put trial process beyond any reasonable. Control 
* Avoiding exploitation of opportunities for less honorable delay and harassment of adversary 
* Opportunity to correct a wrong ruling 
    
Disadvantages and Costs:
* Erroneous ruling may taint everything that follows 
* May become necessary to repeat entire trial proceeding, which could be expensive
* Further proceedings may suffer from lapses of memory, loss of evidence, etc. 
* Retrial proceedings affected by lessons learned at the first trial (strategies revealed and must be revised, etc.) 
* Some areas of law must develop without much opportunity for appellate guidance (e.g.  questions of discovery)
