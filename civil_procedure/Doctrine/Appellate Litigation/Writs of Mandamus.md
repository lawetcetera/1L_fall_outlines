# Writ of Mandamus
Instruction to a judge from a higher court to stahp
The respondent is the trial judge

Two types:
* Common Test (irreparable harm) - unlikely to be granted
	* a party can show there's an emergency situation (like a preliminary injunction)
	* clear and indisputable right to relief (similar to likelihood of success on the merits analysis)
	* in the court's discrtionary view, is this writ good to grant?
* Supervisory Writ - La Buy
	* risk of recurring issue
	* courts generally unlikely to grant because they're awkward
