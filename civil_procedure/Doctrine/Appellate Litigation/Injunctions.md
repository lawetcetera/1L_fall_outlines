# Injunctions

Per [[28 U.S.C. ยง 1292#a 1|28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(a)(1)]], the grant or a denial of an injunction is immediately able to be appealed.

**NOTE**: A refusal to rule on an injunction cannot be appealed, as it is not a final judgment, see [[Thane-Coat]]. In this case, the only relief potentially available would be to petition for a [[Writs of Mandamus| writ of mandamus]].
