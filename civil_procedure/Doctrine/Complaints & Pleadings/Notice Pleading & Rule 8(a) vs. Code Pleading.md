# Notice Pleading and Code Pleading
## Code Pleading
A well-pleaded complaint must assert underlying facts that will be used to prove each component of the cause of action.

## Notice Pleading
A well-pleaded complaint must articulate enough information for a defense attorney to investigate the claim. Asserting a legal conclusion can be enough, so long as it is tied to a specific transaction/time/place/etc.
