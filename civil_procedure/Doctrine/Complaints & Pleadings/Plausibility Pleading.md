# Plausibility Pleading
Plausibility pleading is the modern standard for a well-pleaded complaint. Plausibility pleading can be argued to be [[Notice Pleading & Rule 8(a) vs. Code Pleading#Code Pleading|code pleading]] just under a different name.

A well-pleaded complaint must state a *plausible* prayer for relief. The underlying facts must rise above the threshold of being purely speculative.

## [[Twiqbal]] test:
1. Ignore all statements in the claim that are legally conclusory.
	* "He was driving negligently" -> conclusory
	* "He was texting while driving" -> not conclusory
2. Look to what is left. Does it nudge the complaint over the line of merely possible to plausible?
	* It is important to note that this requirement severely limits plaintiff's access to justice, as all of this information must already be available to them prior to discovery in order to survive the motion to dismiss and make it to discovery.
	* This also takes into account any possible innocent explanations for the facts alleged
		* In [[Iqbal]], worse conditions of confinement for Muslim men were explained away as innocent rather than discriminatory by the reasoning that an investigation into 9/11 would naturally lead to majority Muslim suspects

## Policy Reasons
* Discovery is very expensive, and this protects parties that may be innocent from having to undergo that expense
* But, this means that meritorious claims have a higher bar for accessing the information they need in order to prove their merit, and are more likely to be dismissed
