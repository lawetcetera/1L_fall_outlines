# Motion to Dismiss

## Bases for a motion to dismiss under [[Black Letter Law/FRCP/Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12#b 6| FRCP 12(b)(6)]]
1. The facts alleged are simply to fantastical
	* think alien abduction litigation
2. The cause of action asserted by the plaintiff does not supply a theory of relief as applied to these facts.
	* For example, some laws only provide causes of action against state actors. A lawsuit by students against a professor asserting this kind of cause of action would be dismissable under [[Black Letter Law/FRCP/Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12#b 6| FRCP 12(b)(6)]]
3. Insufficient specificity
	* Historically, either [[Notice Pleading & Rule 8(a) vs. Code Pleading| Notice Pleading or Code Pleading]]
	* Modern standard is [[plausibility pleading]], see [[Twiqbal]]
