# Vertical Choice of Law

How do you resolve when relevant state and federal laws are inconsistent or conflict? The short answer is: it's complicated and no one really knows.

Federal courts used to make up their own common law substantive rules to apply to cases, but this was done away with in [[Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins]].

Ultimately, [[Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins]] changed the conception of vertical choice of law to favor *vertical consistency* (i.e., between federal and state courts in a given state) and *horizontal consistency* (i.e., between federal courts of different states). The previous regime articulated by [[Swift v. Tyson]] favored horizontal; [[Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins]] favored vertical.

## Erie and its Justifications
* The common law is created rather than divined by judges.
	* Under [[Swift v. Tyson]], courts understood common law to be a brooding omnipresence in the sky: something objective that courts captured rather than authored.
	* Under [[Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins]], the common law came to be understood as something that was created by judicial decisions
* Constitutional Justifications
	* Federalism - most governing buisiness in the U.S. is to be done by the states. Therefore, their rules should apply for most issues. Since Congress cannot create rules in many areas, federal courts ought not to be able to make up law in them either.
	* Separation of Powers - federal courts should not be making law; they should only be applying the laws created by Congress
	* Equal Protection - a different set of substantive laws applying in federal courts has given an advantage to out-of-state plaintiffs in giving them an option not available to in-state plaintiffs
* State common law is the law of the several states under [[28 U.S.C. ยง 1652| The Rules Enabling Act]] (statutory justification)
	* Under [[Swift v. Tyson]], it was not, because the common law was conceived of as existing objectively, and therefore was not "of the states"
	* Under [[Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins]], judges make the law, so judge-made law in the states is naturally "of the states"
* Prudence
	* The [[Swift v. Tyson]] regime just was not working well in practice; people were subject to two different legal regimes in any given territory, making it difficult to plan their activities. Prudence favors *vertical consistency*
	* Federal courts were supposed to handle the minority of cases, but forum shopping led to them starting to crowd out state courts.
	* We want to discourage forum shopping.
	* **NOTE**: Greiner sees Erie as a "purely prudential decision;" be sure to mention prudential considerations on policy questions

## The Four Erie Tests
How does one determine whether law is substantive or procedural?

### The York test
1. If the law applied will determine the outcome of the case, use state law.
	* Here, determinitive is meant in the context of the entire case rather than one small part of it (e.g., class certification)

**NOTE**: The law applied will almost always determine the outcome of the case. As a result, this test will almost never be the law.
* For example, consider a violation of procedure that will result in dismissal

### The Hanna majority
Harlan holds that if a federal law is **valid** and **applicable**, it should be applied, per the [[Black Letter Law/Constitution/U.S. Constitution Art. VI#Supremacy Clause|supremacy clause]].

The question of what is "valid and applicable" is less straightforward than it sounds.

#### What is the source of law?
Interpretations of Hanna apply the valid and applicable test differently depending on what the source of law is:
* [[#The Constitution]]
* [[#A statute]]
* [[#FRCP]]
* [[#Federal Common Law]]

#### The Constitution
**Is the Constitution valid?**
Yes, next question.

**Is the Constitution applicable?**
Perform a normal exercise of statutory interpretation. Do not read the provision flexibly.

#### A statute
**Is the statute valid?**
Check for a source of power in the Constitution under which Congress could pass this statute (e.g., commerce clause, power to create lower federal courts, full faith and credit clause, necessary and proper clause). If there is such a source of power, the federal statute is valid.

**Is the statute applicable?**
Does it answer the question at bar? Perform a normal exercise of statutory interpretation, but with slightly more willingness to read flexibly such that it will not conflict with the state statute.

#### FRCP
**Is a FRCP valid?**
The limit established in the [[28 U.S.C. ยง 1652|Rules Enabling Act]] as understood under [[Sibbach]] is that the rule should not "abridge, enlarge, or modify a substantive right". The federal court system has not applied this test textually, but rather in the form of the question of whether the rule "really regulates procedure". If it does, it is valid under the [[28 U.S.C. ยง 1652|Rules Enabling Act]]. ^1b9969
* A federal court has never struck down a rule of civil procedure on the grounds that it "abridged, enlarged, or modified" a substantive right. This will likely never happen. FRCPs are always held to "really regulate procedure"

**Is a FRCP applicable?**
Courts have differed in prescribing how one should read federal rules to test for their applicability. If there is a strong policy interest in upholding a state law, they will look for a way to characterize the conflicting federal rule as valid but inapplicable.

Under *Scalia*:
* Do not interpret the federal rule creatively. If it applies, it applies; if it doesn't, it doesn't.
* Under the Supremacy Clause, if it applies, we should favor federal law.

Under *Ginsburg*:
* Interpret the federal rule creatively. If it can be interpreted in such a way that it does not conflict with the state rule, use that interpretation, and subsequently apply the relevant state law.

#### Federal Common Law
Do not apply the valid and applicable test. Apply the "twin aims of Erie":
* prevent forum shopping
	* If the rule in question would provide incentive for parties to file in federal court over state court, use the state rule instead
		* This is basically just the [[Vertical Choice of Law#The York test|outcome-determinative test]], but do not call it that here
* prevent the inequitable administration of the law

### The Harlan concurrence in Hanna
1. Would the laws in question have potentially changed the party's pre-litigation conduct?
	* *If yes*: it is a substantive issue, and state law should be applied.
		* We do not want to incentivize pre-litigation conduct based on the availability of a different set of laws in the same jurisdiction
		* Federalism in principle leaves the tasks of regulating human conduct to the states
	* *If no*: it is a procedural issue, and federal law should be applied.

Under this test, Statute of Limitations are thought not to affect pre-litigation conduct, so there is no need to reconcile state and federal limitations periods.

#### Policy justifications
1.  Channeling idea of federalism: states are supposed to regulate primary conduct under our system 
2.  Difference with Hanna majority test is who is adapting their conduct: lawyers (the majority) vs litigants (this concurrence)
3.  Examples: 
	1.  Bonds [[Cohen]]: would mean a lot less lawsuits would be filed, so businesses would act more aggressively b/c they would be less fearful of being sued -> affects pre-litigation conduct 
	2.  Serving of process [[Hanna]] and tolling [[Walker]] -> does not drive pre-litigation conduct
