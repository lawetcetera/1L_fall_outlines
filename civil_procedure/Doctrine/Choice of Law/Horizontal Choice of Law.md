# Horizontal Choice of Law

Each state determines what process it uses to choose which state's law will apply to litigation.

**Note**:  Federal courts use the choice of law rules of the state in which they sit, see [[Klaxon]].

The rules to determine which state's law will be used depend on whether the issue in question is procedural or substantial. The test used to determine whether an issue is really procedural is as follows:
* Would this rule have affected pre-litigation conduct?
	* ifyes: it's substantial
	* ifno: it's procedural

## Procedure

Rule: use the law of the forum state (i.e., the state in which you are litigating).

Examples of procedural issues:
* time limits on filings
* size, color, and nature of paper on which to file
* statutes of limitations
## Substance
For substantive issues, you must perform a horizontal choice of law analysis in order to understand which state's law will apply.
### First Restatement
**Rule**:
1. Use the law of the state where the harm occurred ("lex loci delicti") to all issues in tort.

**Policy Considerations**:
* Ease of administration; cost-saving on litigation over COL issues
* Grouping of law together promotes coherence-- it isn't piecemeal, it's all the law of one area

### Second Restatement

**Rule**:
1. Cut the litigation into each component issue. If appropriate, different states' law will apply to different issues.
2. For tort issues, begin with the presumption of "lex loci delicti", then apply "Section 6 factors" (e.g., center of gravity of events, state interests, etc.) to see if you ought to apply the law of a different state.

**Policy Considerations**:
* Promotes justice because you can pick and choose the law most relevant to each issue
* Allows the policy of the forum most relevant to each issue to be put into practice
* Danger of "frankenlaw," or incoherence when stitching together the laws of different forums
