# Issue Preclusion

Issue preclusion is a **very different** thing than [[Claim Preclusion]]. Issue preclusion only applies to matters argued and decided in an earlier lawsuit. Issue preclusion is sensitive to the posture of the parties in the previous lawsuit; we only issue preclude losers.

We do not preclude parties who have not had their day in court. We want to make sure everyone has an opportunity to litigate.
* Privity applies here in the same way it does with [[Claim Preclusion]]

Sometimes different sources of law require relitigation of the same facts. If there factual issues in common between the different suits, we may allow issue preclusion where the facts are the same, see [[Marrese]].

## Elements
1. Same issue
	* *Issue* is narrowly defined here and is almost always factual (*stare decisis* is the doctrine that prevents the relitigation of legal issues)
	* For example, in a negligence claim, issues would include
		* Whether there was a duty of reasonable care
		* Whether the defendant's behavior was the cause-in-fact
2. Necessary to the decision
	* When a general decision is issued in a case where one issue or the other could reasonable have produced that decision, and the decision does not specify which of the issues it leaned on, then neither can be said to have been necessary to the decision. Neither are precluded, see [[Russell v. Place]]
3. Actually litigated
	* From record or by extrinsic evidence, the precise question must have been raised and determined in the prior suit
	* Policy: 
		*  Parties in first forum might have lacked urgency to litigate each particular issue; case might not have been worth it 
		*  Parties have sufficient incentive to raise issues in the first lawsuit without preclusion because they are trying to win
		*  If parties had to litigate every possible issue that could come up or else face preclusion, cases would be insane (vs claim preclusion, where we want all parties to asset all theories of relief)

### Stealth Elements
* Mutuality - some jurisdictions require this, others do not. Different jurisdictions that do require this have different definitions for it
	1. The New York view - no mutuality required
	2. Strict mutuality - require the same parties across both lawsuits in the same procedural posture
	3. Less strict mutuality - require the same partiOes, but do not require them to be in the same procedural posture
	4. Federal common law view - [[#Defensive|DNMCE]] is okay; [[#Offensive|ONMCE]] is not

## Nonmutual Collateral Estoppel
### Defensive
See: [[Blonder Tongue]]

Defensive nonmutual collateral estoppel ("DNMCE") is generally allowed. It allows a new defendant in a later lawsuit to rely on a judgment adverse to the same plaintiff in an initial lawsuit to preclude the that plaintiff from litigating that same issue against them.

### Offensive
See: [[Parklane Hoisery]]

Offensive nonmutual collateral estoppel ("ONMCE") is generally not allowed. It would allow a new plaintiff in a later lawsuit to rely on the decision against the same defendant in an initial lawsuit in order to preclude that same defendant from defending on the same issue.

### Why?
By allowing DNMCE, we incentivize the plaintiff to bring the suit against all parties he wishes to litigate against.

Were we to allow ONMCE, it would incentivize the secondary plaintiff to sit out of the first lawsuit, see how it goes, and then decide whether she can leverage the decision in her favor.

Together, these serve to further the policy goal of minimizing the number of lawsuits arising out of a single transaction or occurrence.
