# Intersystem Preclusion

## Rendering Court is State
### Subsequent Court is State
**Source of Law**: [[U.S. Constitution Art. IV#§ 1]]; [[28 U.S.C. § 1738]]
**Effect**: Subsequent state uses rendering court’s law (both claim and issue preclusion); At least as much preclusive effect as state A (Hart)

### Subsequent Court is Federal
**Source of Law**: [[28 U.S.C. § 1738]]
**Effect**: Subsequent state uses rendering court’s law (both claim and issue preclusion) ; At least as much preclusive effect as state A (Hart)

## Rendering Court is Federal
### Subsequent Court is State
#### Rendering Court sat in Diversity
**Source of Law** federal common law, see [[Semtek]]
**Effect**: Borrow law of state in which rendering court sits; At least as much preclusive effect as state A (Hart)

#### Rendering Court had SMJ
**Source of Law**: federall common law
**Effect**: Apply: (1) Federal law (as much preclusive effect as federal law); (2) Parklane / Blonder Tongue if needed; (3) Uniform Federal Rules

### Subsequent Court is Federal
#### Rendering Court sat in Diversity
**Source of Law**: federal common law, see [[Semtek]]
**Effect**: Borrow law of state in which rendering court sits; At least as much preclusive effect as state A (Hart)

#### Rendering Court had SMJ
**Source of Law**: federal common law
**Effect**: Apply: (1) Federal law (as much preclusive effect as federal law); (2) Parklane / Blonder Tongue if needed; (3) Uniform Federal Rules

**NOTE**: If an exam questions ask about a situation where a rendering federal court had SMJ, argue the policy implications of using uniform federal common law rules that are horizontally consistent or the law of the stat in which the federal court sits, which would be vertically consistent.

## Federal Common Law on preclusion
[[Marrese]]:
-   Prohibits federal courts from precluding claims that would not be precluded under state rules 
-   In most cases, Marrese will prevent preclusion -- this is bc virtually every state follows the "prior jurisdictional competency" rule, which prohibits preclusion of a claim beyond the rendering court's jurisdiction (and state courts can't hear cases when the federal court's jurisdiction is exclusive) 
-   Traditional claim preclusion attaches where the second lawsuit concerns the same claim and the same party and the first judgment was “on the merits,” unless the rendering court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the second lawsuit’s theory of relief -> ISSUES MAY STILL BE PRECLUDED 
	-   Typically happens with regard to the [[Subject Matter Jurisdiction#Subjects with exclusive federal jurisdiction|federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over certain types of claims]]
    
[[Semtek]]
-   When rendering federal court is sitting in diversity, effect of judgment will be judgment law of the state in which rendering court is sitting (i.e. state preclusion law governs) 
    
[[Migra]]
-   Subsequent court must give at least as much preclusive effect as the rendering court would have given in its own system to that judgment 

Federal Rendering had [[Subject Matter Jurisdiction]], subsequent state court or federal court:
-   Apply federal common law in terms of preclusive effect (NMDCE- Blonder Tongue; NMOCE –  [[Parklane Hoisery]]) 
-   Can a subsequent court give more preclusive effect than the rendering court? [[Hart]]
	-   Greiner: unresolved, but it appears that the court in Hart gave more preclusive effect to the judgment than the rendering court did
	-   There's some indication that SCOTUS will someday tell us that this can't happen, but no hard and fast ruling

Transfers:
-   If the case was transferred to the rendering court and the transferor court was a happy court: 
	-   Just a “change of courthouse” 
	-   Transferor’s court’s laws on preclusion (mutuality, on the merits, etc) applies 
	-   Subsequent rendering court applies as much preclusive effect as the transferor court would have 
-   If the case was transferred to the rendering court and the transferor court was an unhappy court: 
	-   Apply the preclusion laws of the state in which the court sat (assuming diversity)

Supplemental Jurisdiction:
-   Break up federal law and state law and apply FQJ to federal and treat diversity to state
-   Argue both sides: on the one side (don’t want to mix and match preclusion, on the other treat like a diversity case

## [[Marrese]] Test for Preclusive Effect of a State Court Judgment
Two-step approach for determining the preclusive effect of a state court judgment in a subsequent suit over which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction: 
1. Applying the Full Faith and Credit Statute, the federal court must determine whether state claim preclusion law would preclude the federal suit. 
	* Identify the law of the rendering court that states the preclusive effect of the judgment. 
		*  This will typical hinge on: 
			*   “On the merits” (for claim preclusion) 
			*   Approach to mutuality (for issue preclusion) 
	*    Determine the preclusive effect that judgment would have in rendering court’s system. Would it be precluded? 
		*  If no, no preclusion. 
			*  Giving Full Faith and Credit to a judgment = giving at least as much effect to rendering court’s judgment that the rendering court judge would. The more permissive a state's preclusion law is, the more likely the subsequent court will have to preclude.
		*  If the state WOULD bar the federal action, move on to step 2:
2.  Federal court must determine whether the relevant federal law contains an implied or explicit exception to 28 USC § 1738.
