# Claim Preclusion
AKA *res judicata* (Greiner does not appreciate the use of this phrase)

Under the doctrine of claim preclusion, a claim may be "merged" or "barred" by a party's failure to raise the claim in a prior action. This is the "use it or lose it" doctrine; even claims as well as theories of relief that were not raised in previous litigation may be precluded. This is meant to incentivize parties to bring every possible claim they can in the course of litigation.

**NOTE**: Claim preclusion is agnostic to which parties prevail; the point is that the litigation is over.

**NOTE**: Claim preclusion only ever applies to offensive postures; defenses are never precluded.

## Stated Elements
**NOTE**: These elements operate under Holy Roman Empire rules; none of them actually mean what the text would imply they mean
1. Same party
	* Parties that are in privity with each other count as the same party for claim preclusion purposes.
2. Same claim
	* *Claim*, here, means the same **transaction and occurrence**
		* The facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation such that they form a convenient trial unit if merged (e.g., the same evidence would be presented)
3. A judgment that is final on the merits
	* *Final* only means having reached a judgment at the district level; cases that are on appeal are considered "final" for claim preclusion purposes
	* *On the merits* means what you think it means, and then it also means
		* whatever the courts want it to mean in order to accomplish their policy objectives. When thinking about this, do not think about whether it was really "on the merits," only whether the court would like it to be for whatever they're trying to accomplish

### On the merits?
Do not question why any of these are the case; they just are. If asked to justify them, just argue both sides of policy considerations.

**On the merits**
* Failure to appear & default judgment is preclusive for counterclaims (Jones) (but argue if it is for primary suit)
* An involuntary dismissal (failure to prosecute, comply with rules/court order) is an adjudication on the merits 
* Settlements 
* Statute of limitations (for FEDERAL) 

**Not on the merits**
* Motion to dismiss for lack of [[Subject Matter Jurisdiction]], [[Personal Jurisdiction]], or [[Venue]]
	* In order for a ruling to have preclusive effect, the issuing court must have the jurisdiction to do so
* Dismissal for [[Forum Non Convieniens]]
* A judgment issued "without prejudice"
	* Here, the rendering court is limiting its own judgment
* Statute of limitations (for STATE – can vary state to state) 

**Bonus round**
* Special Topic: Voluntary dismissal under FRCP 41 
	* A plaintiff can voluntarily dismiss before opposing party answers or moves for summary judgment without the court’s permission
		* Without prejudice the first time
		* The second time it is an adjudication on the merits
	* If court gives permission to P to dismiss, it is without prejudice
* Special Topic: Statute of Limitations 
	* Scenario: dismissed on SOL in one state, but then brought in another state that has a longer SOL
		* Procedural or substantive arguments would come into play here
		* Limitations based dismissal on the merits? In the context of preclusion we will face HCOL issues 
			* States differ and say that limitations-based dismissals are based on the merits while the others say that they are not on the merits 
		* If the point of limitations period is to prevent stale evidence, then there shouldn’t be preclusion because each state can make its own decision on what’s stale
		* If the point is that defendant can be in repose (lazy), then claim preclusion should apply

### Stealth elements
* Check if the rendering court of the original lawsuit has not limited the claim preclusive effect of its own judgment (i.e., "without prejudice")
* Check if the rendering court had jurisdiction over the claim to be precluded in the latter lawsuit, see [[Marrese]]

## Exceptions
We do not want claim preclusion to disrupt markets, so it is held not to apply to transactions for the sale of closely related but separable items
* The example from class: the sale of a bond with attached coupons, which are secondarily sold to other parties, despite privity between parties

When litigating missed payments on installment contracts, we want the lender to bring one suit for all payments that have been missed to date. However, at the time of litigation, it is unknown whether the debtor will miss any future payments. Any payments yet to be missed on the same installment contract are separate claims for claim preclusion purposes.

## Policy justifications
* We think it's most efficient to throw all relevant claims into the same lawsuit. Claim preclusion serves to incentivize that, by limiting the availability of bringing such claims in a later suit.
* Avoid unfair harassment of the defendant
* Do not allow a plaintiff to repeatedly mulligan their jury
* Avoid the risk of inconsistent results across forums
