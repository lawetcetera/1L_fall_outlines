# Preclusion and Administrative Agencies
See: [[Restatement (Second) Of Judgments § 83(2)]]

Common law tells us that agency adjudication has preclusive effect, given sufficient indications of due process 
-   [[28 U.S.C. § 1738]] and [[U.S. Constitution Art. IV|Full Faith and Credit]] clause do not apply because neither consider it; the administrative state is younger than those laws

Basic doctrine: if you comply with procedural due process requirements, you can have preclusive effect
-   [[Restatement (Second) Of Judgments § 83(2)| The Restatement]] struggles with how to operationalize that concept 
-   Note: Procedural due process factors are different in [[Opportunity to be Heard#Vitek Factors|Vitek]] and in the Restatement 
	* [[Restatement (Second) Of Judgments § 83(2)| The Restatement]] doesn’t require discovery or appeals 
	* [[Vitek]] says certain people need counsel; the restatement does not 
    
-   Remember that [[issue preclusion]] has a discretionary component to it 
So if the agency *lacked the power to propound discovery on each other, or compel witnesses, if there is some limit on adjudicatory ability*, a court may choose not to preclude because you didn’t have opportunities in first lawsuit that you now have in the second lawsuit
