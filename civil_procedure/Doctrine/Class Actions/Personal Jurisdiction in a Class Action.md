# Personal Jurisdiction in a Class Action

So long as there are sufficient procedural protections in place, it is fine for a court to assert [[Personal Jurisdiction]] over unnamed plaintiffs who are a member of a class.


## Minimal Contacts in a Class Action
If the claims of only some members of the class have minimal contacts with the forum, it is an open question as to whether that is enough to allow the entire class to assert [[Specific Jurisdiction]] or just [[General Jurisdiction]].
* In a simple joinder case, [[Bristol Meyer Squibb]] tells us that state courts may not assert jurisdiction over some of the plaintiff claims that lack minimal contacts with the claim and the forum under [[Specific Jurisdiction|specific personal jurisdiction theory]], just because other plaintiffs in a simple joinder case meet the requirement for minimal contacts.
	* Because under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4#k 1 A| Rule 4(k)(1)(A)]], a federal court can only exercise personal jurisdiction when a court of the state in which it sits would be able to, this also applies to federal courts in a simple joinder context.
* The certification of the class may be held to create a new legal entity, analogous to a trust. Or it may be held to just be an aggregation of simple joinders.

## Venue
You can lay venue wherever you can exercise personal jurisdiction under [[28 U.S.C. § 1391#c|  § 1391(c)]].

A significant portion of the events occuring in a given forum is likely enough to lay venue under [[28 U.S.C. § 1391#b 1| § 1391(b)(1)]] or [[28 U.S.C. § 1391#b 2| § 1391(b)(2)]].
