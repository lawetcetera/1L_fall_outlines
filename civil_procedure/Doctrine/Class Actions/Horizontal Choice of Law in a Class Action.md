# Horizontal Choice of Law in a Class Action

**NOTE**: Remember that per [[Klaxon]], federal courts will apply the HCOL rules of the state in which they sit.

Do a standard [[Horizontal Choice of Law]] analysis relative to each member of the class.
* This means lots of different states' laws will apply
	* If these laws differ too much, this may defeat [[Certification and Mechanics#Commonality|commonality]] during the certification process.
	* Some courts will abandon this traditional approach with class actions and just apply the law of a single state to the claim. Under [[Shutts]], this is only okay if all claims meet a lowered threshold of a minimal contacts analysis.
