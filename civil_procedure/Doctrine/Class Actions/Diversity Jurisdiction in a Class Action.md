# Diversity Jurisdiction in a Class Action

If a class action lawsuit has [[Arising Under Jurisdiction]], it can assert jurisdiction over that alone. Otherwise, it must assert [[Diversity Jurisdiction]].

## Complete Diversity
When considering whether the parties in a class action lawsuit meet the requirement of [[Diversity Jurisdiction#Test for Diversity Jurisdiction|complete diversity]], only the state of the named plaintiff matters, not the state of the unnamed class members, see [[Tribe of Ben-Hur]].

## Amount in Controversy Requirement
One named plaintiff in a class action lawsuit must meet the [[Diversity Jurisdiction#Test for Diversity Jurisdiction |amount in controversy requirement]] of over $75,000.

All other plaintiffs whose claims do not meet the amount in controversy requirement may be added by asserting [[Supplemental Jurisdiction]] under [[28 U.S.C. ยง 1367#b|28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(b)]], see [[Exxon]].
* This can only works against a single defendant
	* The Court held that class actions follow the same rules as simple joinder claims, where the amount in controversy deficiency does not destroy diversity jurisdiction under [[28 U.S.C. ยง 1367#a|  ยง 1367(a)]]
		* The reasoning here tracks with the [[Diversity Jurisdiction#Policy Considerations|policy goals of diversity jurisdiction]]
