# Certification and Mechanics

## Numerousity
The class is so numerous that joinder of all its members is impracticable
* As a rule of thumb, courts will not certify classes made up of fewer than twenty people, and generally will certify classes of more than forty
* This analysis is also relative to the size of the claims; smaller claims give more reason to certify

## Commonality
There are questions of law or fact common to this class.
* Hard under [[Walmart]]. In order to have commonality, must show that the common contention is capable of classwide resolution
* Sometimes destroyed by [[Horizontal Choice of Law in a Class Action]]

## Typicality and Representativeness
These usually merge.

Whether a named plaintiff's theory of relief is sufficiently close to the theories of relief of the unnamed class members.
* Check for conflicts of interest between class members; if some want to hold out for more money later vs if some of them need it now. This may cause a class to fail on representativeness.

## Damages class requirements
### Predominance
The questions common to the class predominate over questions affecting individual members
* In 23(b)(3) action, *this subsumes the commonality requirement*

### Superiority
A class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy
