# Forum Non Convieniens
## When do you use *forum non convieniens*?

Ordinarily, there is a presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of forum. This presumption is only overcome when the public and private interest factors clearly point towards trial in an alternate forum.

You use FNC to argue to a state court that the case ought to be transferred to the court of a different state, or abroad. It is also used in federal court when a defendent wants the court to dismiss the case and invite the plaintiff to refile abroad.

Not used to transfer between federal courts. For that, you use [[Transfer| the transfer statutes]].

### Public Interest Factors
* Court conjestion
* Whether it's fair to require a jury to sit in this forum over this issue

### Private Interest Factors
* Cost of travel to & from litigation
* Whether witnesses can be compelled to travel this far to testify
* Access to documents and evidence

## Compromises

A defendant can agree with the court not to raise [[Personal Jurisdiction|personal jurisdiction]] and [[Venue|venue]] defenses to bargain for a determination of *forum non convieniens*

## Policy Considerations
* Litigants love to sue in the United States
	* The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are generally thought to be pro-plaintiff as compared to those of other nations:
		* Contingency fees
		* Tort awards
		* Access to discovery
		* Possibility of class relief
