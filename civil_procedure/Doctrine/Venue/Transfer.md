# Transfer

**Greinerism**: a *happy court* is one which has both [[Personal Jurisdiction|personal jurisdiction]] and [[Venue|venue]].

## Must I transfer?

You must transfer or dismiss if the court in which you filed is not happy.

## May I transfer?
Governed by Hoffman vs. Blaskey

You may transfer if the transferee court would be a happy court, or if plaintiff and defendent both agree on a transferee court.

If there is no happy court to which you can transfer, you cannot transfer and the case may have to be dismissed.

## Should I transfer?
This undergoes the same analysis as *[[Forum Non Convieniens|forum non convieniens]]*-- presumption in favor of plaintiff vs. public and private interest factors.

## What happens if I do?
Transfers raise questions of how to conduct proper [[Horizontal Choice of Law|horizontal choice of law]] analyses. Given that federal courts [[Diversity Jurisdiction|sitting in diversity]] will use the choice of law rules of the state in which they sit
1. If the transferor court was a happy court, then use the choice of law rules of the transferor court (not to deny plaintiff the benefit of having filed there).
2. If the transferor court is not a happy court, then use the choice of law rules of the transferee court.

## How do forum selection clauses change this?
A forum selection clause shifts the presumption from the preferred forum of the plaintiff to the forum in the clause.

Then, in the court will proceed to disregard private interest factors when conducting its transfer analysis, as those were waived by entering into this contract.

If the case is transferred to comply with a forum selection clause, then the transferee court's choice of law rules will now govern.
