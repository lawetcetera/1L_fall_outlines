# Venue

Federal venue statutes dictate in what district one must file a lawsuit. Venue is created only by these statutes. There is no constitutional basis for venue.

## Terminology
* A plaintiff can/cannot *lay* venue.
* Venue can be *proper* or *improper*
* You cannot *have* venue; that is incorrectly stated.

## Venue Test
1.  In the district where one defendant resides if all defendants reside in the state in which the district is located, see [[28 U.S.C. § 1391#b 1| 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)]].
	* If the defendant is a person: where he is domiciled 
	* If the defendant is a corporation: where its incorporated and principal place of business, or if state could exercise [[Personal Jurisdiction| personal jurisdiction]] over the corporation
2. Where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, see [[28 U.S.C. § 1391#b 2| 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2)]].
	* or, if this suit is *in rem* or *quasi in rem*, where the property is located
3.  If there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided above, then venue exists in any judicial district in which at least one defendant is subject to [[Personal Jurisdiction| personal jurisdiction]], see [[28 U.S.C. § 1391#b 3| 8 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(3)]].
	* If some defendants are not subject to personal jurisdiction in this district, they can successfully move to dismiss on grounds of lack of [[Personal Jurisdiction|personal jurisdiction]], but not on improper venue grounds.

## How do venue and [[Personal Jurisdiction|personal jurisdiction]] differ?

SImply, you can have one but not the other. For example, there may be personal jurisdiction but not venue if a plaintiff files in a 
state that has jurisdiction, but in a district in which none of the events occurred.

**NOTE**: State courts also have venue statutes which govern in what county one must file
