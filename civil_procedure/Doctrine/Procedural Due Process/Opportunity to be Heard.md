# Opportunity to be Heard

The [[U.S. Constitution Ammendment XIV § 1| Due Process Clause]] gives individuals the right to be heard before the government acts to deprive them of property or liberty.

**What kind of property does the Due Process Clause mean?**
This refers both to traditional notions of property, either real or chattel, as well as to government issued designations and benefits (e.g., food stamps, driver's license)

When evaluating whether a process as a whole meets the requirements of the [[U.S. Constitution Ammendment XIV § 1| Due Process Clause]], evaluate it using the [[#Sniadach Factors]].

When evaluating whether a specific change would cure a constitutional defect in a procedural scheme, apply the [[#Matthews v Eldridge Test]].

When constructing a new procedural scheme from scratch, or seeking to construct a counterfactual procedural scheme as part of an attack on an existing one, use the [[#Vitek Factors]].

## [[Matthews v. Eldridge]] Test
This test is most useful for attacking a scheme's constitutionality.

Balance among the following factors:
1.  Private interests that will be affected by the official action 
2.  Risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards 
	*  Measure two counterfactual states of the world: state that plaintiff would have us be in, and state we are currently in. Which one would have the greater risk of erroneous determination? 
	*  Examples of high risk without hearing: writ of attachment for assault/battery (need for testimony, inadequate written submissions, relies on conclusory affidavits & doesn't lend itself well to documentary proof)
	*  If a determination can confidently be made only looking at documents (e.g., medical records for worker's insurance), then the need for a live hearing is considered not to be as strong.
3.  Government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional and substitute procedural requirement would entail 
	* Government will always have an interest in reducing costs of adjudication but will also have an interest in accuracy (ensuring public trust).
		* Consider whether a judge can delegate these determinations to a clerk-- it would cost less and be more expedient, but the clerk may have a higher risk of making an erroneous determination

## [[Sniadach]] Factors
Courts look at: 
1.  *Who*: whether a judge or a clerk is the decision-maker (possibility of error) 
2.  *What*: whether the party seeking relief has a pre-existing interest in the property to be seized or encumbered 
3.  *When*: whether the seizure is effected before notice and hearing, or is followed by an immediate post-seizure hearing;
4.  *Why*: whether the seizure is to establish jurisdiction or for security purposes, and if for security purposes, whether exceptional circumstances such as destruction of an asset are presented;
5.  *How*: whether the applicant must show probably cause or meet a lesser burden of proof; whether factual allegations must be sword to under penalty of perjury and based on personal knowledge; and whether the dispute can be resolved by uncontested documentary evidence

## [[Vitek]] Factors
[[Vitek]] is one district court's attempt to codify a minimum set of requirements for a procedural scheme to be constitutional. It is most useful when creating a new scheme, or curing an existing one that has been found to be unconstitutional.

Required:
1.  Written, adequate notice (with time to find help/representation if possible)
2.  Independent decision-maker
3.  In-person hearing 
4.  Evidentiary, adversary hearing (opportunity to present testimony and witnesses) 
5.  Written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the decision 
6.  Availability of appointed counsel for indigent prisoners (legal help not required) 
7.  Effective and timely notice of all the foregoing rights

Not required:
* Discovery
* Appeal
* Record of proceedings
