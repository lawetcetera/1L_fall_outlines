# Notice
**NOTE**: Notice also has some bearing on [[Personal Jurisdiction]]. It is an open legal question whether it confers general or specific personal jurisdiction.
## Service of Process
Two things are required to get a lawsuit started:
1. File the complaint with the Court
2. Serve process on the defendant
	* Service of process is a term used to describe the delivery of legal documents (usually the summons and the complaint) that notify the defendant that they have been sued and inform them that the court is asserting its jurisdiction over the controversy.

**How does one serve process?**
Every state will have different rules. The two most common are
* *in hand* - otherwise known as tagging in which someone must physically hand the complaint to the defendant
* *leave complaint at defendant's house* - with a responsible adult
	* This is allowed under the FRCP, but not allowed under the laws of some states

**NOTE**: A lawsuit that is dismissed for improper service of process will not preclude the plaintiff from refiling, but if the limitations period is up prior to filing a second time, then the suit will be thrown out.

**When does the lawsuit commence, for statute of limitations purposes?**
Most states use a scheme under which, so long as the plaintiff files before the limitations period expires, they have a "grace period" (Greinerism) of some fixed length during which they may serve the defendant, even if service occurs after the expiration of the limitations period.
* The federal grace period is [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4#m|120 days]].
* The length of grace periods in different states varries.

Notice has both a [[Mullane|constitutional minimum]] and a [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4| statutory minimum]].

### Constitutional Minimum
The [[Mullane]] court articulated that under the [[U.S. Constitution Ammendment XIV ยง 1| Due Process Clause]], efforts to serve process must be "reasonable under all circumstances."
* One test for reasonableness is to pretend you care if the defendant actually gets served. You are required to act how someone who actually cares about service would.
* Duty to act reasonably to provide notice does not stop after the first attempt. Reasonable follow-ups are required.
* Courts usually avoid imposing requirements that would make it more expensive to file a lawsuit (i.e., certified mail is not necessarily required; regular mail will do)

The Court has not held that actual notice is ever required. You can extinguish someone's rights without it, and that's just fine.

### Statutory Minimum
[[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 4| FRCP 4]] governs the requirements for service of process in federal courts. The requirements under Rule 4 are more strict than the constitutional minimum required by the [[U.S. Constitution Ammendment XIV ยง 1| Due Process Clause]].

If service of process was not properly handled, but the defendant is somehow aware of the lawsuit, they can move to dismiss under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12#b 5|FRCP 12(b)(5)]].
