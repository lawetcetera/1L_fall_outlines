# Relief Pending Litigation

## Motion for a Preliminary Injunction
A preliminary injunction may be granted when:
1. The movant is substantially likely to prevail on the merits of their claim
	* a reasonable probability of eventual success
	* including procedural merits such as [[Subject Matter Jurisdiction]], [[Personal Jurisdiction]], and [[Venue]]
2. The movant would suffer irreparable injury unless such relief is granted
	* If damages will be a proper remedy later, then the harm is not irreparable
	* Typically applies when
		* *Damages would be inadequate*:  subject matter of contract is of special nature/particular value that damages would not be just and reasonable substitute for the requested relief
		* *Damages are impracticable*:  some special and practical features or incidents of contract in its subject matter, in terms or in relations of parties, makes it impossible to arrive at legal measure of damages at all, or w/ any degree of certainty, so that no real compensation can be obtained by action of law
3. The potential injury to the movant outweighs any injury that might be caused to the opposing party
4. Granting this relief would not disserve the public interest.
	* Consider the facts of [[Thane-Coat]]: seeking relief to be able to continue exporting goods after having knowingly violated the law in exporting products to a country in violation of sanctions.

**NOTE**: Some jurisdictions (e.g,. the fifth circuit) require all four factors to be met. In other jurisdictions (e.g., the ninth circuit), a strong showing on one factor may make up for a less-than-persuasive showing on other factors.
