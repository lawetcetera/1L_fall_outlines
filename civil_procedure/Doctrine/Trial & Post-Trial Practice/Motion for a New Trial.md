# Motion for a New Trial

[[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59| FRCP 59]] governs motions for a new trial. Granting or denying this motion is within the discretion of the trial judge and **is not able to be reviewed on appeal except for the most exceptional circumstances**

## Judge's Considerations
A court can consider granting a motion for a new trial under the following circumstances:
1. Reversible error
	* A party can move for a new trial when hoping to persuade the judge that he has already made what an appeals court would clearly find to be a reversible error, and skipping the process of going through an appeal in order to be granted a new trial would just be a waste of everyone's time
2. "Against the great weight of the evidence"
	* The judge finds the jury's verdict not to be unreasonable, but to be "against the great weight of the evidence"
		* This is a mulligan for a new jury
3. [[Additur & Remittur]]


## Differentiating from [[Motion for Judgement as a Matter of Law|JAMOL]]
In the event that there is substantial evidence supporting the verdict, a judge is not able to direct the verdict "the other way." They can, however, grant a motion for a new trial if they personally believe that the clear weight of the evidence goes "the other way."
* This is most relevant with regard to issues of credibility. If a judge thinks a witness was lying but the jury does not, he can issue a motion for a new trial, but would have to presume credibility in favor of the nonmoving party when deciding whether to issue a JAMOL.
