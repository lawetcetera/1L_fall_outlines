# Findings of Fact & Conclusions of Law
Per [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52|FRCP 52]], we ask judges to provide us with findings of fact and conclusions at law. The motivations for this include:
-   Quality of decision-making: if trial judge is required to state reasons, they are more likely to reach a just conclusion 
-   Letting the appellate court know the trial court’s reasoning 
-   Ability to apply decision in future instances 
	-   “What was litigated once should not be litigated again” 
	-   Clarifies what has been decided and what hasn’t for [[Issue Preclusion|preclusion purposes]]

Why do we not ask juries to provide us with the same?
-   Many minds = jurors might agree on an outcome, but not why 
-   Reasoning might change our mind about the justness of the decision
-   May not trust juries to be so competent as to be able to write down their reasons 
-   Have you ever tried writing something with eleven co-authors? Why put anyone through that...

## Findings of fact
Prior to being able to issue a judgment, we require judges to issue findings of fact. These need not be written down.

The judge can also adopt one parties proposed findings of fact verbatim.
* This will not affect the standard of review an appeals court employs
