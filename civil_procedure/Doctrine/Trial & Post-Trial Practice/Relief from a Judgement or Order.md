# Relief from a Judgment or Order

[[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60|FRCP 60]] governs motions for relief from a judgment or order. These are a mechanism of last ditch effort, typically only filed after a party has lost in both trial court and on appeal.

These are **very, very** rarely granted, despite the broad language in the rule. The court system strongly values finality of litigation.

## Bases for granting a Rule 60 motion
* Mistake and negligence
* Newly discovered evidence
* Fraud
