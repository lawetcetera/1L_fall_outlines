# Judgment as a Matter of Law

A motion for judgment as a matter of law is a motion made by a party during trial claiming the opposing party has insufficient evidence to reasonably support its case. It is governed by [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 50| FRCP 50]]
* It argues that no rational jury could find for the nonmoving party, even if all inferences were drawn in its favor.

## Moving while a jury is sitting as a trier of fact
In order to file a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the moving party must
1. File a pre-verdict motion
	* If a judge does not grant this, they are not regarded as having denied it, but rather deferred it until after the jury issues its verdict, at which point it will re-evaluate.
2. Renew the motion after the verdict is issued
	 * Per the above, the judge may reconsider the motion at this point
	 * Also known as judgment *non obstane verdicto* (not withstanding the verdict).

Appeals courts will only consider the possibility of error in denying a motion for judgment as a matter of law if the moving counsel did both of the steps above.

## Judge's Considerations

When evaluating whether to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law, a judge is supposed to consider:
* Make all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party (including disputes of credibility)
* Then, ask if any reasonable jury could find in favor of the nonmoving party
	* *If yes* - deny the motion for JAMOL
	* *If no* - grant the motion for JAMOL

On appeal, motions for judgment as a matter of law are reviewed ***de novo***.
