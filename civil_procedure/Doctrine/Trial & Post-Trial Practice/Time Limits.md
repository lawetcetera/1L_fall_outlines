# Time Limits

Per [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12#b 2| FRCP 12(b)(2)]], time limits for [[Trial & Post-Trial Practice#Various off-ramp mechanisms available during a suit|the motions considered in this section]] may not be extended. They are fixed at 28 days.

## Policy reasoning
* Efficiency and expense
	* provide the parties with certainty of the end of litigation
	* we as a society have already invested considerable resources into having a trial; we do not want to expend those again if we can help it
