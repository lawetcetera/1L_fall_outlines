# Jury Instructions
Jury instructions are one of the ways in which trial judges control & cabin jury discretion.
    
The judge will typically ask parties to give him proposed jury instructions; in federal courts. Circuits have circuit-specific general instructions that are given to jurors (e.g. what evidence to consider) 
    
Two general rules apply to jury instructions:
-   A party needs to raise the issue of jury instruction in a timely manner in order to preserve the issue for appeal 
	-   If you want something, you need to ask for it from the trial judge in a timely manner. If not, appeals court will either refuse your appeal or only review for plain error. 
	-   If you don't like something, you should object to it, or the same thing happens. 
-   Harmless Error Principle: if an appeals court encounters an error that it believes was harmless (i.e., did not affect outcome), it will refuse to reverse the decision despite the presence of the error.
	-   This is the appeals court’s most powerful way to affirm decisions 
	-   There is a narrow class of issues that fall under the umbrella of “structural error” (e.g. party demands a jury trial, is entitled to one, but doesn’t get it) that is not subject to harmless error analysis 
-   In Kennedy, Ninth Circuit holds that when a party has requested an instruction that is close to being correct, trial judge is under obligation to correct instruction and issue it 
	* Greiner is not sure that this is the law in all circuits

**NOTE**: Jury instructions are only ever read to jurrors. They are not delivered in writing. Jurrors are not allowed to take notes on what the instructions are. This should tell you a lot about what the legal system really thinks about jurrors.
