# Fact vs. Law

The categories of "questions of fact" and "questions of law" have been the traditional touchstones by which courts have purported to allocate decision-making between judge and jury. 

New issues are categorized in the same way as whether a new cause of action is [[Right to a Jury Trial#How do you determine where a new cause of action fits| at law or in equity]], with the exception of what to do if there is no suitable analog. Given no suitable analog, courts take into account **function**: which decision-maker is better suited to handle a given issue.

## Judge
Judges are better for working with:
-   Interpreting law (statutes, administrative regulations, case law) 
-   Analyzing written documents 
-   Uniformity of decisions; stare decisis
-   Very long running, technical cases

## Jury
Juries are regarded as being better for working with:
-   Credibility of testimony
-   Common person perspective â€“ anything requiring more representativeness (negligence; obscenity standard) 
-   Demographic diversity 
-   Reflecting community standards
