# Right to a Jury Trial

[[U.S. Constitution Amendment VII| The Seventh Amendment]] continues a practice from English common law of distinguishing civil claims which must be tried before a jury (absent waiver by the parties) from claims and issues that must be heard by a judge alone. The amendment did not create the right to a jury trial; it “preserves” the right. This means that there is a right to a jury trial if there would have been one in 1791.

It only governs federal civil courts. It has no application to civil courts set up by the states when those courts are hearing only disputes of state law. 
    
## Law vs. Equity
Cases **at law** are those that were brought to courts of law in 1791. These continue to carry the right to trial by jury in cases in federal courts.

Suits **in equity** are those that were historically decided by the chancellor under English law. They continue to be decided by judges (although judges can, at their discretion, employ an advisory jury).

### How do you determine where a new cause of action fits?
1. Try to find the best historical analog for it in terms of the types of parties involved and the legal relationships between those parties.
	* For example, [[Chauffeurs v. Terry]]: the court found the best analog to the breach of fair representation by union leaders was the relationship between trusts and trustees in the case of breach of fiduciary duty
2. **More important**: Examine the remedy sought and determine whether it is legal or equitable in nature

In the cause of action is a mix of both law and equity, then usually courts will err on the side of jury trial.

### Relief available at law
Relief at law is generally limited to the following:
* Compensatory damages: money paid to someone who has been harmed to remedy this harm.  
* Punitive damages: damages that are over and above compensatory damages to punish/deter damages. 
* Ejectment of a defendant who wrongfully is occupying plaintiff’s land 

### Relief available in equity
Equity provides remedies when the law does not, including:
* Injunctions: orders from a court to an individual telling them to do something (e.g. desegregate a school system; perform on a contract)  
* Restitution: “disgorgement of ill-gotten gains” 
* Rescission: a declaratory judgment voiding/canceling a contract 
* Reformation of contracts 
* Trust enforcement: compelling trustee to do something that they said they would do

### What do you do with new decision makers (i.e., administrative law judges)?
Agencies (probably) cannot sit jury trials. They benefit from the **public rights exception** to the right to a jury trial. This exception props up most of the administrative state.

The test for whether the public rights exception is available is as follows: ^38888d
1. The government is involved on one side of the dispute
2. The government is acting as a regulator or sovereign, not as an economic actor


**NOTE**: Sometimes you will have to apply both the [[#How do you determine where a new cause of action fits| Chauffeurs test]] and the [[#^38888d| public rights exception test]], in the event that the government has created a new cause of action and then lodges adjudication power of that new cause of action to an agency decision maker.
