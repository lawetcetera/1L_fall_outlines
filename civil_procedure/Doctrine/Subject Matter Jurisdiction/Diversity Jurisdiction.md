# Diversity Jurisdiction
Federal courts have "diversity jurisdiction", per [[28 U.S.C. § 1332]] to hear cases between citizens from different states

## Policy Considerations
* State courts are believed to be biased against out-of-state residents. Federal courts offer what is believed to be a more neutral venue for litigation between plaintiffs from different states.

## Test for Diversity Jurisdiction
1. **Is there complete diversity?** In order for a federal court to have diversity jurisdiction, the case must have "complete diversity". This means that every plaintiff must be diverse from every defendent. In cases where plaintiffs are diverse from only some defendents, the case is said to have "minimal diversity". See [[Strawbridge v. Curtiss]].
2. **Does the amount in controversy exceed $75,000?** Because federal courts were meant to be used sparingly, the amount in controversy requirement was created as a barrier of "importance" for cases to reach the federal courts.

### Determining Citizenship
#### Individuals
* Place of domicile: last place you lived without intention to leave at a particular time/event. “You are where you are until you get where you’re going.” 
* Test: 
   * Reside somewhere 
   * Intention to return if you leave
   * Determining domicile: 
   * Begin with birthplace 
   * Is there an end date/natural leaving date? 
   * Where does the person pay taxes/vote/have an ID? 
   * Did they purchase property or do they rent? 
   * Doesn’t have to be a permanent commitment; no particular time or plan to leave will suffice.
* Things that don’t change domicile: 
   * Going to school elsewhere 
   * Parents moving to other places 
   * Marrying foreigners [[Mas v. Perry]]

### Corporations
* Corporations are citizens of: 
	* State of incorporation, AND 
	* Principal place of business 
* For many years, 3 tests for principal place of business existed: 
	1.  Nerve Center Test (CURRENT): state in which corporate decision-making and overall control take place.
	2.  Corporate Activities/Operating Assets: state in which the corporation has its production of service activities. 
	3.  "Total activity" test: citizenship located in light of all the facts and circumstances. 
*  Hertz Corp v. Friend (SCOTUS, 2010) ruled that “principal place of business” in [[28 U.S.C. § 1332#c 1|  § 1332(c)(1)]] refers only to corporation’s nerve center. Why? 
	1.  Terms of statute 
	2.  Legislative history 
	3.  Simplicity of clear rule that could "discourage gamesmanship"

### Unincorporated Associations
* Partnerships: any state in which its partners are citizens 
* Unions: any state in which its members are citizens
