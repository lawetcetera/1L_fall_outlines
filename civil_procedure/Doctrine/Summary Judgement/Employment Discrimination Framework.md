# Employment Discrimination Framework
Employment discrimination suits follow a special progression of burden shifting, see [[Burdine]]:
* Plaintiff starts out with burden of production of *prima facie* in cases of employment discrimination 
	* ex., Applied for position, minimally qualified for position (met basic qualifications), denied position, member of a protected class (have some characteristic), position filled by someone outside class or remained open, plus something extra (??) 
* If the plaintiff produces evidence that meets this burden, the burden of production shifts to the defendant to produce evidence of legitimate non-discriminatory reasons
	* This evidence need not persuade the court (just burden of production, not persuasion) but must clearly set forth, through introduction of admissible evidence, reasons for rejecting the plaintiff's claim
* Whereupon if the defendant does that, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove by burden of persuasion that the defendantâ€™s stated reasons were pretextual.
	* If plaintiff successful, then the case goes to trial
	* If they do not, the court grants summary judgment 
    
 These arguments are intensely factual and closely tied to the cause of action, have to cite specific facts. ***On the exam, look for facts and apply them.***
    
**Why is there special burden shifting for Employment Discrimination cases?**
    
Employment discrimination cases typically preclude a "smoking gun." This pattern of burden shifting gives the defendant a chance to state their legitimate reasons, should they exist, and makes it so that the case is reasonably likely to make it to a jury.
