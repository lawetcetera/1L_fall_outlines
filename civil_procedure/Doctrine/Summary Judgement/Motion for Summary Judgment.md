# Summary Judgment Generally

[[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 56|FRCP 56]] governs motions for summary judgment. Courts initially granted these cautiously and reserved them for weeding out "frivolous and sham cases." Now, motions for summary judgment and [[Motion to Dismiss|motions to dismiss]] are frequently how cases are decided.

When talking about motions for summary judgment, the **summary judgment record** is the universe of evidence that a court uses to analyze whether a motion for summary judgment can be granted. It is constructed by parties by attaching excepts from discovery materials to memoranda in support or in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.

Motions for summary judgment can be partial. A party can move for summary judgment on some but not all claims or on individual parts of claims, see [[Celotex Framework]].

## Summary Judgment Test
In order to succeed in a motion for summary judgment, a movant must show:
1. That there is no disputed material issue of fact; AND
	* where an issue of material fact would be any fact that could allow a factfinder to decide against the movant
2. That the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law
	* see [[Celotex Framework]]
