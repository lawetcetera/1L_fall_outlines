# The Celotex Framework

Under the Celotex Framework, what is required of parties to succeed in moving for summary judgment is different depending on whether the moving party bears the burden of persuasion at trial.

This framework is taken almost entirely from Justice Brennan's dissent in [[Celotex]].

## Burden of Production vs. Burden of Persuasion

The **burden of production** is the burden to produce evidence which, if unrefuted, is sufficiently powerful to say that a "rational trier of fact" would have to find in that party's favor.
* This burden can shift throughout the case

The **burden of persuasion** is the burden to convince the factfinder to view the facts in a way that favors that party.
* If evidence is in perfect balance, or *equipoise* (e.g., if there is no evidence), then the party that bears the burden of persuasion loses.
* This burden does not shift throughout the case.

**NOTE**: the "shifting of a burden" is a mental exercise undertaken by the judge while evaluating static memos. There are not rounds of evidence production; each party makes their best case up front and hands it off to the judge, who then must decide whether to grant or deny the motion based off of these memoranda.

## The Framework
First and foremost, identify whether the moving party bears the burden of persuasion on this set of issues.
* Who would lose if there were no evidence?

### If the movant bears the burden of persuasion at trial
Usually, this is the plaintiff.

1. The movant has burden to produce evidence that, if unrebutted, would compel a rational trier of fact to rule in her favor: would a reasonable trier of fact, drawing all reasonable inferences for the nonmoving party, find for moving party? 
2.  *If yes* – If facially plausible and unrebutted (i.e.: uncontroverted at trial, verdict in movant’s favor) – burden of production shifts to the nonmoving party, who must:
	* Show that there is a “genuine issue” for trial, or 
	* Submit an affidavit requesting additional time for discovery. 
3.  *If no* - deny motion for summary judgment.

### If the movant does not bear the burden of persuasion at trial

Usually, this is the defendant.

1.  *Affirmative Evidence Route*: submit affirmative evidence that negates an essential element of nonmoving party’s claim. 
	* Evidence needs to “knock out” some element of the other party’s case. 
	* If plaintiff bears burden of persuasion for all elements of claim, knocking out one of them usually makes the whole claim go away.
	*  If party chooses this route, court asks: if this was the only evidence I had, could a rational jury do anything other than find in the moving party’s favor?
		* *If yes*: burden of production shifts to other party to show that there is a genuine issue of material fact. 
		* *If no*: deny motion for summary judgment. 

2.  *Insufficient Evidence Route*: demonstrate to the court that the nonmoving party’s evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element of the nonmoving party’s claim. 
	*  Must affirmatively demonstrate to the court that there is no evidence in the record to support a judgment for the nonmoving party. 
	*  Can’t just be a conclusory statement: need to make the other party’s case as best as possible given the evidence, and then show it doesn’t work. 
	*  Burden of production shifts back to nonmoving party; they need to “cast the issue back into doubt”
	*  Judge must decide if the nonmoving party has produced sufficient evidence as to raise a genuine issue of material fact.
		*  *If yes*: deny motion for summary judgment
		*  *If no*: grant motion for summary judgment
