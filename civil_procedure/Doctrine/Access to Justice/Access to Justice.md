# Access to Justice

Civil defendants are not entitled to counsel at state expense, see [[Lassiter v. Department of Social Services]]. Even if incarceration is at issue. The question of how to ensure they still receive access to justice is an open one; creating a right to counsel in civil cases would likely only burden public defenders further.
