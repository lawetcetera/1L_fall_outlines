Territorial Limits of Effective Service.
## (k)(1)
_In General._ Serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant:
### (k)(1)(A)
* who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located;
### (k)(1)(B)
* who is a party joined under Rule 14 or 19 and is served within a judicial district of the United States and not more than 100 miles from where the summons was issued; or
### (k)(1)(C)
* when authorized by a federal statute.

# (m)
Time Limit for Service. If a defendant is not served within 90 days after the complaint is filed, the court—on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff—must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision (m) does not apply to service in a foreign country under Rule 4(f), 4(h)(2), or 4(j)(1), or to service of a notice under Rule 71.1(d)(3)(A).
