# In Personam

The vast majority of lawsuits are *in personam*.

1. A plaintiff sues a defendant in a state, the case is litigated, and the court finds for the plaintiff and awards money damages.
2. If a defendant refuses to pay, the plaintiff can then find where the defendant owns property (either in that same state or in another) and file a second suit in which the plaintiff requests the court of that state seize and sell the property so that plaintiff may recover what was awarded in the first suit.

The defendant can then either:

1. Appear and waive *in personam* jurisdiction. Then proceed to litigate only on the merits of the case.
2. Appear and litigate whether the forum court has *in personam* jurisdiction over him.
	* If the court finds it does not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant, the case is dismissed.
		* Dismissal on personal jurisdiction grounds is appealable in the appellate court of that same state.
	* If the court finds it does have personal jurisdiction over the defendant, the defendant can then proceed to litigate on the merits.
		* If defendant loses on the merits, then the defendant can appeal on both the grounds of personal jurisdiction and the merits. These appeals must happen in the appellate court of that same state.
3. Default (i.e., just don't show up to court)
	* Court in this state will almost always enter a judgement against an absent defendant.
	* Plaintiff then attempts to use the judgement from this state to induce the court of the state in which defendant's property sits to seize and sell that property.
		* If the defended defaulted in the original suit, the defendent can now litigate whether the original state had personal jurisdiction in this new state's courts.
			* If the court finds that the original state did in fact have personal jurisdiction over the defendant, the defendant can appeal this decision, but cannot appeal on the merits.

**NOTE**: In the above example of two different suits, the two "different" states mentioned can be the same state.
