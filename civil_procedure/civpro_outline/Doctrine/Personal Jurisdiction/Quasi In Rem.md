# Quasi in Rem

*@TODO sort of killed by Schaffer v. Heitner*

A *quasi in rem* suit is brought against an individual who the plaintiff perceives as unlikely to pay out and use their property as collateral.

The lawsuit must be initiated in the state where the property sits.

1. A court "attaches" a piece of property "in" its geographic jurisdiction.
2. Plaintiff then must prove that the defendant wronged the plaintiff in some way that would ordinarily result in damages.
	* Here, the property itself is utterly unrelated to the basis of the lawsuit (*for the purposes of this class*)

Outcome: If the plaintiff prevails, the court sells the property, pays out the plaintiff up to the amount of the claim, and gives the defendant the amount left over. Here, recovery is limited to the value of the property.

## When would you want to bring a suit *quasi in rem*?

* This kind of suit dates back to when individuals might be very difficult to locate/contact. Its primary benefit is a guarantee of some source of recovery.
	* Consider, for example, suing a foreign national who owns property in the US, but could simply leave US jurisdiction if made to pay liquid damages.
