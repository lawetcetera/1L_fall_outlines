# Removal

Removal is automatic. It happens instantly, as soon as the defendant files papers in the federal court. Cases are automatically removed to the federal court in whose district the state court is located, per [[28 U.S.C.  ยง 1441#a|28 U.S.C.  ยง 1441(a)]]

**NOTE**: Plaintiffs cannot remove, see [[Shamrock Oil]].

# Remand

Any motion to remand at any time will be granted when the district court determines (prompted or *sua sponte*) that it lacks [[Subject Matter Jurisdiction|subject matter jurisdiction]].

## Procedural Defects

If a party promptly (i.e., within 30 days of the removal) files a motion to remand and points out one of the following defects in removal procedure, the motion to remand will be granted:
1. In a [[28 U.S.C. ยง 1332|diversity-only case]], if any of the defendants sued is a citizen of the state in which the litigation was pending.
	* Allowing this would nullify the policy considerations upon which diversity jurisdiction is grounded.
2. Removal occurred more than 30 days after the removable event.
	* Removable event is usually defined as the filing of a complaint under which there is [[Subject Matter Jurisdiction|federal jurisdiction]]. Sometimes other events, like the dismissal of [[Diversity Jurisdiction|non-diverse parties]] or the addition of a [[Arising Under Jurisdiction|federally created cause of action]].
	* Encourages parties to decide quickly where to litigate.
3. Not all defendants signed the removal petition.
	* Presumption is against federal courts as the place for trial court litigation. If any defendent wants to keep it in state court, then we keep it there.
4. There is a one year time limit on ability to remove diversity-only cases that have been pending in state court.
	* Important to note that the case will still be removed automatically, so this still requires a prompt filing by the plaintiff of a motion to remand.
