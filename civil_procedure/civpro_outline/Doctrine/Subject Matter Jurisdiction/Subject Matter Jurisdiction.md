# Subject Matter Jurisdiction Generally

State courts have general jurisdiction; they can hear just about any case, with the exclusion of cases with [[#Subjects with exclusive federal jurisdiction | exclusive federal jurisdiction]]. It is important to note that these exceptions are due to an act of Congress, and not because state courts are not competent to hear such cases.

Congress has the power to give lower federal courts jurisdiction over cases, as declared in [[U.S. Constitution Art. III ยง 2#cl 1|U.S. Constitution Art. III ยง 2, cl 1]].

Federal courts must notice their own subject matter jurisdiction *sua sponte* (of their own volition), see [[Mottley]]. Subject matter jurisdiction can be brought up at any stage of litigation.

## Two Key Presumptions
* When Congress enacts a federal statute, the presumption is that both the federal and the state courts have competence to enforce the law (with some important, but narrow, exceptions) 
* Federal court jurisdiction was intended to be the exception, not the rule, by the framers (this is no longer a reality; "leviathan" of federal litigation) 

## Subjects with exclusive federal jurisdiction
* Federal securities-law class actions 
* Bankruptcy 
* Patents and copyrights 
* Actions against foreign consuls and vice-consuls 
* Actions to recover a fine, penalty, or forfeiture under federal law 
* Actions involving certain seizures

## Why might a litigant want to begin a lawsuit in federal court vs. a state court? 
* Supremacy clause: law is supposed to be the same in federal vs. state court (federal law is always supreme where it applies) 
* Federal judges are not elected; in the absence of a duty to constituents, they might litigate in a different way than a state court judge (who could be elected might) 
* Shopping for jury pools: some litigants may try to pick demographics of jury pool by deciding where to file 
* Different rules of civil procedure
