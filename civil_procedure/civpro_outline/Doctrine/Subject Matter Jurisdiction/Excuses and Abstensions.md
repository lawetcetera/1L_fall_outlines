# Excuses and Abstensions
A district court may refuse to hear a case even if it has [[Subject Matter Jurisdiction| subject matter jurisdiction]] and [[Personal Jurisdiction| personal jurisdiction]], and [[Venue| venue]] is proper. For example, district courts usually refuse to probate wills or issue a divorce decree. Their (circular) justification is defference to state court expertise in these kinds of matters.

# Abstension Doctrine
The abstension doctrine has four branches. The first three are outside the scope of this class.

## Colorado River Stay
The fourth is the [[Colorado River]] Stay. 
* This requires the conditions of
	1.  simultaneous federal and state court litigation
	2.  between substantially the same parties
	3.  about substantially the same issues.
* Under these circumstances, the district court may issue a stay on its litigation (i.e., a pause, not a dismissal)
* According the Supreme Court, ordinarily we won't do this because lower federal courts have an "unflagging obligation" to exercise their jurisdiction; ergo, Colorado River Stays should only be issued under exceptional circumstances.
	* totality of circumstances test, including such considerations as
		* convenience for parties and witnesses
		* desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation
		* judicial efficiency
		* relative stages of each case
		* intent of congress
		* whether a federal stay will influence ongoing state proceedings
* If a stay is not issued, whichever case reaches judgement first will supercede the other, and the other will be terminated.
