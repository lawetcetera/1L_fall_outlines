# Supplemental Jurisdiction
Supplemental jurisdiction is the authority of United States federal courts to hear additional claims substantially related to the original claim even though the court would lack the subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the additional claims independently.
 
 [[28 U.S.C. § 1367 ]], the statutory basis for supplemental jurisdiction, emerged after a long string of cases ([[Gibbs]], [[Owen]], [[Aldinger]], [[Finley]]) as a way for Congress to “lay down the law” 
 
## Policy Considerations
* Judicial efficiency

## Test for Determining Supplemental Jurisdiction
1.  Identify all of the claims in lawsuit (unique plaintiff, unique defendant, unique legal theory of relief).
	* Look at each one, look for independent basis of subject matter jurisdiction, and move on to next claim. 
2.  Isolate all claims that don’t have independent subject matter jurisdiction.
3.  Identify an anchoring claim (may be more than one). 
4.  Look at supplemental claims and for each ask: 
	1.  [[28 U.S.C. § 1367#a|§ 1367(a)]]: Is there original jurisdiction over the action, such as [[28 U.S.C. § 1331|§ 1331]], [[28 U.S.C. § 1332 |§ 1332]], § 1335, § 1338, or some other basis for "original" subject matter jurisdiction?
		*   If so, you have supplemental jurisdiction over any additional clams and the joinder or intervention of additional parties. BUT: 
	2.   [[28 U.S.C. § 1367#b|§ 1367(b)]]: Is original jurisdiction based solely on [[28 U.S.C. § 1332| § 1332]]?
	* Would applying supplemental jurisdiction over any supplemental claims be inconsistent with [[28 U.S.C. § 1332|§ 1332]]? (E.g. would one or more of the supplemental claims fail to satisfy the amount in controversy or otherwise destroy complete diversity?) 
	* Would any of the supplemental claims fall under one of the joinder scenarios in [[28 U.S.C. § 1367#b|§ 1367(b)]]? 
	* If your sole basis for jurisdiction in the case is diversity, district court shall not have supplemental jurisdiction over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rules 14, 19, 20 or 24, if the exercise of such jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the exercise of jurisdiction under [[28 U.S.C. § 1332 |§ 1332]] (aka would kill diversity by parties or AIC).
	* **NOTE**: Exxon tells us that if there are multiple P’s and one D and one of them meets the AIC, that is sufficient for the AIC of them all; however, you must maintain complete diversity. 
5. If claims satisfy (a) or (b), courts still may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under  [[28 U.S.C. § 1367#c|§ 1367(c)]], which grants discretion to the court to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the supplemental claim, if: 
    * Supplemental claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law (i.e. state courts are better equipped to decide new or difficult state-law issues). 
   * Supplemental claim substantially predominates over the claim(s) over which district court has original jurisdiction (i.e. supplemental claim is main issue). 
	* District court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction (i.e. less of a need for federal forum). 
	* There are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction. 
    * **NOTE**: If court decides to decline to exercise jurisdiction based on (c), must agree with Gibbs values (economy, convenience, fairness, and comity)
