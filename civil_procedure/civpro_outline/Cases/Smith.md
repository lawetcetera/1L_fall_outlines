## Facts
* Directors and officers of a corporation had excess funds with which they bought federal bonds.
* Shareholders used a shareholder derrivative cause of action (state law) against directors and officers on the theory that said bonds were worthless because the federal goverment does not have the power to issue bonds.

## Holding
Federal issue is embedded in the state law cause of action, because there was no possible way to hold on the shareholder derivative suit without first answering the question of the constitutionality of federal bonds.

## Rule
Federal courts have jurisdiction to hear cases with federal issues embedded even if they do not arise under a federally created cause of action.
