**RULE**: Absent state statutory law, federal courts apply “general law”
    
1.  For 100 years, the SCOTUS decision in Swift provided the basic interpretation of the [[28 U.S.C. § 1652]] Rules of Decision Act (“law” as meant in the statute is statutory state law, not state common law) 
2.  Idea that pre-existing law is “found” by federal courts: state common law is not law, it’s “evidence” of law, and may thus be wrong, unlike federal “general law”
