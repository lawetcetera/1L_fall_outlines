# Attack Outline
   Contract law represents the unstaded assumptions that need not be explicitly spelled out (though may sometimes be contracted around) in every binding agreement made between parties.
   
   Contract law rests on the assumption that parties are acting in their own self interest towards a mutually beneficial result. The law believes each party expects to come away from a contracted transaction better off for it. The law most often comes into play when reality deviates from this expectation.
