In Hamer v. Sidway, a rich uncle promised his nephew that he would pay him $5k upon the nephew turning 21 years of age, provided the nephew refrained from drinking, smoking, swearing, gambling, etc.

The court found consideration in this agreement, because the nephew forewent activities that he was legally entitled to participate in.

**NOTE**: This case is not dispositive as to cases in which a party refrains from engaging in illegal activity (Kennedy's favorite example of which being not smoking crack)
* Could argue no consideration because promisee didn’t have a legal right to do it anyway
* Could argue that there’s no enforcement of contracts that facilitate illegality, but this would be facilitating following the law
	* Courts generally refrain from evaluating the details of what consideration is provided it is present in some form, so it is unclear if they should care that the refrained-from behavior is illegal
