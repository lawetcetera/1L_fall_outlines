# Public Policy Considerations of Non-Enforcement

## Illegal Contract
The law wants neither to encourage nor to implicitly endorse illegal activity.

*His Excellency Abdulaziiz Bin Ibrahim Al-Ibrahim v. Edde* ^7fffdc
*  No recovery for illegal contract where employee claimed employer’s gambling winnings for tax purposes
 
## Non-Competition Clause
Limited non-competition clauses are typically enforceable as a way to protect the private interest of the business. If the clause is so broad as to be broader than necessary to protect the interests of the business or to run counter to the public interest, the clause can be ruled unenforceable.

*Valley Medical Specialists v. Farber* ^431ccf
* Restrictive covenant between physician and former employer found invalid because scope of activity, geographic scope, and duration too broad and against public interest
	* Covenants with physicians are more strictly construed than others because of public policy concerns
    
## Freedom
### To Contract
Freedom to contract encourages the formation of mutually beneficial agreements that create value in the world. Habitual failure to enforce contracts increases uncertainty during contract formation, increases risk, and encourages hedging against reliance on contracts.

### From Invidious Discrimination
You cannot decline to contract with someone on the basis of their membership to a protected class

## Breach of Promise to Marry
Breach of Promise to Marry is treated by the common law as a hybrid of tort and contract breach. There are more tort-like remedies available than simple breach of contract (i.e., punitive damages)

*Bradley v. Somers* ^cb55a7
* No recovery for loss of the opportunity to stay married to first husband when second fiance didn’t marry her; limited to damages on the particular breach of promise to marry, not on losses from prior marriage (think opportunity cost)
	* A promise of marriage made while married to another is void
 
*Gilbert v. Barkes* ^367c76
* This case ablished breach of promise to marry in this jurisdiction as a cause of action; just use breach of contract
	* Arguments against breach of promise to marry as a cause of action:
	* Sexism and paternalism
	* Women have more power now and no longer need the law to correct for their place in society
	* Realizing you don’t want to get married and not following through is better than following through even though you don’t want to
	* Marriage used to be an economic contract, but now it’s about love
	* People can still sue under breach of contract
* Arguments to keep breach of promise to marry as a cause of action:
	* Stare decisis - it’s a longstanding remedy
	* Gives women options/rights; recognizes their unequal place in society & how marriage interacts with that
	* There’s paternalism everywhere in the law, so why is it a problem here?
 
## Surrogacy
*The Case of Baby M* ^e8d5ad
*  Monetary incentive may make a mother’s decision less voluntary
	* Money also means baby will often go to highest bidder, not best parent
* Coercion of contract - mother needs to agree irrevocably even prior to conception to terminate her parental rights and surrender the child to adoptive parents 
* Laws usually require proof of parental unfitness or abandonment before termination of parental rights is ordered
* Best interests determination isn’t sufficient
* If possible, children should remain with both natural parents
