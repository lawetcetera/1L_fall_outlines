# Duress

Duress is a possibile justification for nonperformance. It is similar to [[Undue Influence]], but is generally more coercive and heavy-handed.

Courts have broadened this doctrine to include economic duress. The threat need not be physical; social and economic pressure can be sufficient to void a contract. This is a departure from the traditional doctrine of duress, which held that threat of bodily injury or harm was a necessary factor.
* For example, consider a contract made between former lovers under the threat of posting intimate photos publicly.

**NOTE**: a related concept, usury, describes behavior such as price gouging during natural disasters
