# Undue Influence

Undue influence is a potential justification for nonperformance. It involves the use of excessive pressure by a dominant party to persuade a vulnerable individual. It is similar to [[Duress]], but generally has less to do with specific coersion and more to do with odd and unusual circumstances.
* For example, consider the sale of a house far below market value hastily conducted between a doctor and an elderly homeowner who has just been diagnosed with cancer.

## Seven Factor Test
The following seven factors are considered in claims of undue influence. Not every factor must be present, but each can support a finding of undue influence when weighing the circumstances as a whole.
1. Discussion at unusual place/time 
2. Consummation of contract in an unusual place 
3. Insistent demand that business be finished at once 
4. Extreme emphasis on untoward consequences of delay 
5. Multiple persuaders against one victim 
6. Absence of third-party advisers 
7. Statements that there is no time to consult attorneys or other advisors
