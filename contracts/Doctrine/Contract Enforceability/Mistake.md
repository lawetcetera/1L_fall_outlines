# Mistake

Mistake is a possible justification for nonperformance. A mistake is when someone has a belief about the state of the world that is not the same as the actual state of the world. Misjudgements do not meet the threshold of being mistakes. A party seeking to invoke mistake cannot be said to have assumed the risk of it.

## Mutual
Mutual mistake is one shared by both parties in an agreement. In order for a mutual mistake to justify nonperformance of a contract, it must have been made "as to a basic assumption upon which the contract was made... [and have] a material effect on the agreed exhange of performances," see [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 152]].

## Unilateral
Courts are typically reluctant to allow a party to justify nonperformance due to their own mistake at the time the agreement was made. The exception to this is when the other party knew or had reason to know of the mistake at the time the agreement was made, see [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 153]]; see also [[Fraud & Misrepresentation]].
