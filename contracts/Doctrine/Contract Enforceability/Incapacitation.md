# Incapacitation

Incapacitation is a possible justification for nonperformance. Contracts made with a mentally ill individual are voidable if the following conditions are met:
* “He is unable to understand in a reasonable manner the nature and consequences of  the transaction, or… 
* He is unable to act in a reasonable manner in relation to the transaction and the other  party has reason to know of his condition," see [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts  § 15]].

The current standard of review requires that the mental illness be medically classified and that a doctor testify that the patient was unable to rationally enter into the contract.
