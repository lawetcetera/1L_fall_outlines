# Minority

Minority, also known as the infancy doctrine, is a possible justification for nonperformance. Contracts made with minors (i.e., formally, those who have not reached the legal age of majority in their state) may be voidable by the minor before or after reaching the age of majority, within a reasonable period of time.

If overreach is found in the formation of the contract, the minor is able to rescind any payment.

The modern rule, also known as the retained benefits rule, holds that when
* the minor has not been overreached;
* there has been no undue influence; 
* the contract is fair and reasonable;
* the minor has paid money on the purchase price; and
* the minor has taken and used the article purchased

then the minor is responsible to the seller for reasonable compensation for the use of and the depreciation in value of the item in question while it was in his possession.

## Exceptions
* The sale of food and clothing is not included on the grounds that these human necessities are an area where we do not want to discourage adults from dealing with minors.
* A minor who misrepresents his age may not be able to invoke the infancy doctrine. However, the adult in the agreement has a responsibility to make a good faith, reasonable investigation into the minor's age.
