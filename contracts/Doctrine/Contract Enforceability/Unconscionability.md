# Unconscionability
The doctrine of unconscionability is a possible justification for nonperformance. It is rarely applied, but typically involves situations in which there was an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties to the contract and contractual terms which unreasonably favor the other party. This doctrine is usually applied in absence of [[Duress]] or [[Undue Influence]], but when some other circumstance leads to bargaining misconduct. See [[U.C.C.  ยง 2-302]]

## Substantive
The bargain itself shocks the conscience. The terms of the contract are so extreme as to appear unconscionable to mores and business practices of the society in which they were made.

## Procedural
The imbalance in bargaining power shocks the conscience. No other meaningful choice was available to one of the parties, and as a result the contract was made in bad faith.
