# Impossibility & Impracticability
The doctrines of impossibility and impracticability represent a deptarture from the traditional doctrine of sanctity of contract. The traditional doctrine holds that parties are required to do what they have agreed; it does not allow a contract fairly made to be annulled.

## Impossibility
Where a contract's performance depends on continued existence of given person orthing, a condition is [[Implied Terms|implied]] that should the person or thing perish, rendering performance impossible, it will excuse performance.
* For example, think a lease on an apartment whose building was bombed in a time of war. The apartment no longer exists.

## Impracticability

Performance is excused if the party’s principal purpose is substantially frustrated without his fault by the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, unless the contract language or the circumstance indicate the contrary.
* For example, think failing to cater a wedding that was scheduled to take place the day a hurricane hit.

### Typical Requirements for Impracticability
1. Substantial reduction of the value of the contract 
2. Because of the occurrence of an event, the non-occurrence of which was a basic  assumption of the contract 
3. Without the party’s fault, and 
4. The party seeking relief does not bear the risk of that occurrence of the event either  under the language of the contract or the surrounding circumstances
