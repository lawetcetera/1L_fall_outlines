# Fraud & Misrepresentation
Contracts are vitiated by:
* Misrepresentations of material fact
* Knowledge of the falsity
* Intent to induce reliance
* Actual and justifiable reliance
* Resulting damages

see [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 162]], and [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 164]]

Fraud can also be constructive, in which one breaches her duty in a confidential or fiduciary relationship which induces justifiable reliance in her prejudice.

## Nondisclosure of a material fact, duty to speak
Nondisclosure of a material fact, when done in bad faith, may constitute a material misrepresentation and be tantamount to fraud, see [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 161]]. This contrasts with the traditional "buyer beware" doctrine of *caveat emptor*.
