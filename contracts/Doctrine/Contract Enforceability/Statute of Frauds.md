# Statute of Frauds
see also: [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 110]]

Some clasess of contracts are subject to the Statute of Frauds, which forbids enforcement in the absence of a written agreement. This is meant to encourage the use of a written agreement to avoid conflict in sufficiently substantial/important contracts.

The types of contracts subject to the Statute of Frauds are outlined in [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 110| ยง 110]].

The written agreement required by the Statute of Frauds need not be formal, it just must contain all of the essential terms of the agreement. The instrument must be signed by the defendant.

The Uniform Commercial Code also has Statute of Frauds provisions. The types of contracts subject to these provisions include:
* a contract for the sale of goods for the price of $500 or more
* a contract for the sale of securities
* a contract for the sale of personal property not otherwise covered, to the extent of enforcement by way of action or defense beyond $5,000 in amount or value of remedy

Many states subject other classes of contracts to a Statute of Frauds.
