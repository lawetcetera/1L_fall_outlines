# Implied Contracts

A contract is "implied in law", "quasi-", or "constructive" if it is an obligation imposed by the law without regard to either party's expressions of assent.
* For implied contracts, the general rules of contracts do not apply
* They do not arise from traditional bargaining, but from legal fictions concerning justice and unjust enrichment

To show the existence of an implied contract, one must be able to show
1. that the plaintiff conferred benefit on defendant;
2. that the defendant had appreciation or knowledge of such benefit; and
3. that the defendant accepted or retained benefit under inequitable circumstances


## Constructive Trust
Constructive trust is an equitable device created by law to prevent unjust enrichment

To show the existence of a constructive trust, you must prove
1. Unjust enrichment; and
2. Abuse of a confidential relationship or some other form of unconscionable conduct
