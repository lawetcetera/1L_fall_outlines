# Parol Evidence Rule
Parol evidence, sometimes known as extrinsic evidence, is evidence relating to a contract that does not appear on its face but rather comes from other sources, such as statements between the parties or circumstances surrounding the agreement

## The Rule
The **parol evidence rule** tells us that parol evidence cannot be used to contradict or vary a writing that is the final, full expression of an agreement between the parties.
* Once parties have come to an agreement, that agreement should govern, and nothing else should interfere with that understanding of the agreement
* If the agreement is not final, or it’s final but only a partial agreement, then the parol evidence rule doesn’t apply, and parol evidence can be used.
	* A court determines if a writing is complete based on if it looks to be complete to the court, per the **four corners rule**. This mode of interpretation was championed by Williston.
		* A more modern mode of interpretation, championed by Corbin, holds that it can never be determined by looking at the writing itself whether it is complete and final, because no writing actually speaks for itself. It is necessary to know what the parties intended, which requires the admission of any evidence that is pertinent to that determination. Only after all pertinent evidence has been considered can a conclusion be reached as to the completeness and finality of the writing. In coming to that determination, the judge must be willing to consider all extrinsic evidence, even extrinsic evidence that he will later exclude under parol evidence rule.

## Exceptions to the Rule
The parol evidence rule does not apply:
* for evidence that is employed to show the invalidity of an agreement.
	* Here, the evidence is not seeking to contradict the terms, but is used to argue that there was no agreement to begin with
* for evidence aimed at explaining the writing
	* Here, the evidence is not seeking to contradict the terms, but to flesh out their meaning
* to agreements made after the writing in question
	* The parol evidence rule only applies to agreements made prior to the written document. Subsequent agreements that modify this document indicate that it wasn't final.
