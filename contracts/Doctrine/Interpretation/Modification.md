# Modification
see: [[Black Letter Law/Restatement (Second)/Restatement (Second) of Contracts  ยง 89]], [[U.C.C.  ยง 2-209]]

## By the parties
The main difference between the U.C.C. and the Restatement's rule (linked above) on parties modifying an agreement after it was initially made is the [[Consideration]] for the new agreement-- the U.C.C. demands no consideration, while the Restatement impliedly does.

## By the Courts
Courts sometimes strike down the void/unenforceable parts of a non-compete agreement while upholding the rest. Sometimes they will go as far as to actually modify the agreement to be acceptable, but they generally avoid doing this to encourage a sense in the public that they are free to contract without fear of courts intervening.
