# Material Benefits
The **material benefit rule** holds that when a promisor receives a material benefit from a promisee, the promisor is morally bound to compensate the promisee. If the promisor subsequently promises to make payment on the basis of that moral obligation, the promise is valid and enforceable. This is an example of the court enforcing a promise, *even though no enforceable contract exists*.

* Moral obligation constitutes valid consideration for a subsequent promise if the promisor received a real material benefit, see [[Webb v. McGowin]]
    
A promise made in recognition of a benefit previously received by the promisor from the promisee is binding to the extent necessary to prevent injustice
* When a promise to pay is enforceable because of past material benefit, this is known as promissory restitution
	* Exceptions to this include if the promisee conferred the benefit as a gift, or if the promisor was not unjustly enriched, or if the value is disproportionate to the benefit.
