# Specific Performance
Specific performance is a remedy sometimes available in lieu of [[Money Damages]]. A remedy of specific performance compells the breaching party to act as agreed by the contract (e.g., sell a piece of art for the contracted value despite a recent appreciation in its value). Specific performance is an equitable theory of relief.

In seeking specific performance, a nonbreaching party must show why money damages would not make them whole. It is awarded only if other remedies would be inadequate or impracticable, or if there would be no way to calculate what damages would be.

Specific performance may also be used as a negative injunction, in order to prevent someone from doing something.

## Courts' aversion to specific performance as a remedy
Specific performance runs counter to the traditional understanding of freedoms guaranteed by the state. Courts, acting as an arm of the State, are redisent to order specific performanc unless absolutely necessary, because it compells someone to act almost as an involuntary servant.
