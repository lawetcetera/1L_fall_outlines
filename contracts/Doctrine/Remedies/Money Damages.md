# Money Damages

## Expectation Damages
Expectation damages are the conventional recovery for contracts cases. They are usually compensatory rather than punative. The goal in awarding expectation damages is to make the nonbreaching party whole by putting them in a comparable position to where they would have been had the contract not been breached.

#### Construction Contracts
An injured party may recover damages that are the direct, natural, and immediate consequence of the breach and can reasonably be said to have been in the contemplation of the parties when the contract was made Usually cost of replacement/completion is the measure, even if value of property as a whole isn’t diminished by the unfinished work.
* In cases where there’s been substantial performance but defects exist, the measure of damages is difference in value, but only if the breaching party can show the breach was trivial, made in good faith, and that correction would result in unreasonable economic waste

## Reliance Damages
Normally, profits lost due to breach of contract are recoverable as [[#Expectation Damages]], but if they are too speculative to prove, money spent in reliance on the contract is recoverable instead. The goal in awarding reliance damages is to make the nonbreaching party whole by putting them in a comparable position to where they would have been had the contract never been formed.

Reliance damages are only available when breach has prevented an anticipated gain and has also made proof of loss difficult to ascertain.

*Wartzman v. Hightower Productions, Ltd.*
A lawyer failed to structure a corporation correctly, so the securities sold by that corporation were void and had to be repaid. Due to this mistake, the venture failed. The nonbreaching party could not recover lost profits, as the venture was incredibly speculative, but they could recover the money the founders invested in the venture and the money that must be returned to investors who purchased shares. ^526b03

## Limiting Factors

### Uncertainty
Damages are not recoverable for loss beyond an amount that the evidence permits to be established with reasonable certainty
* As a rule, you cannot recover a windfall (i.e., more than you would have had had breach not occurred) as damages
	* **NOTE**: [[Restitution]] is an exception

### Foreseeability

A defendant can only be held liable for damages that were foreseeable at the time of contract formation. When talking about foreseeability, damages are categorized as *general* and *special*.
*	General damages are the kind that a reasonable person would assume would arise under the normal course of events
*	Special damages are those that arize from special circumstances that a reasonable person could not have known would result from breach at the time the contract was formed
	* Special damages can be recovered if those circumstances were communicated to and known by all parties at the time of contract formation

### Mitigation

In general, nonbreaching parties must take reasonable action to mitigate damages. This can take a positive form (e.g., looking for someone else to fill a vacant apartment) or negative (e.g., stopping contracted work when the contract is breached).

If the nonbreaching party fails to mitigate damages, then the burden of proof falls on a different party depending on the subject matter of the case.
* For example, with lease agreements, the burden of prooving damages *could not* have been mitigated falls on the lessor, because it would be incredibly difficult for the lessee to assemble the information to prove they *could* have mitigated damages.

#### Employment Contracts
Generally, the measure of recovery available to a wrongfully discharged employee is the amount of her salary agreed upon for the period of service, minus what she has earned or could have earned with reasonable effort to find other employment.
* For employment contracts, it's up to the breaching party to show that the nonbreaching party failed to mitigate damages.

### Liquidated Damages Provision
A liquidated damages provision is an agreement between parties at the time of contracting as to the amount of damages that would be awarded in the event of breach. The allow parties to structure and quantify liability.

In order to be valid, liquidated damages provisions must be termed to reflect recovery. They cannot take the form of a penalty. Whether a given clause constitutes a penalty is determined from the circumstances of contract formation.
* If a clause is found to be ambigious as to whether it is a penalty, it is treated as a penalty.

Liquidated damages provisions will not be upheld only if the amount is *grossly disproportionate* to the anticipated harm at the time of contracting.

A nonbreaching party has no duty to mitigate damages if there exists a valid liquidated damages clause, see [[Barrie School v. Patch]]
	*  Liquidated damages are fundamentally different from mitigation of damages because mitigation is part of a court’s determination of actual damages, but with liquidated damages the parties have already determined an amount
	
#### Test for Validity of a Liquidated Damages Provision
A valid liquidated damages provision must contain the following elements:

1. Clear and unambiguous terms for a certain sum
2. Reasonable compensation for damages anticipated by breach
3. Binding agreement - can’t be altered to correspond to actual damages after the fact

In order for a liquidated damages clause to be valid, it must meet one of the following requirements:

1. Reflect a fair estimate of potential damages at the time parties entered into the contract; or
2. At the time parties entered into the contract, damages were incapable of estimation, or very difficult to estimate
