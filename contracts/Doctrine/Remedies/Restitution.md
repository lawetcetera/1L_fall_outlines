# Restitution
Where a person performs services for another which are known to and accepted by the latter, the law implies a promise to pay for those services. Restitution is different from promissory restitution because there is no promise at play.
    
Restitution is a modern designation for the older doctrine of contracts implied in law. A suit for restitution foregoes the opportunity for a suit seeking [[Money Damages]].

An exception to restitution exists when a person officiously confers a benefit upon another. This prevents the law from incentivizing individuals to coerce others into contracts by preemptively providing their services and then demanding payment.

* There is, however, an exception to this exception. Restitution is required even if recipient didn’t request or voluntarily consent to receive service if:
	1. The performance was unofficious
	2. Services were necessary to prevent the other from suffering serious bodily harm or pain
	3. Supplier of services had no reason to know the other wouldn’t consent
	4. Impossible for other to give consent, or consent would’ve been immaterial because of youth or mental impairment

Restitution serves as a remedy for unjust enrichment; a party can’t be unjustly enriched for a benefit they knowingly received, so they ought to be made to pay for it.

The extent of restitution is limited to being made whole. This takes the form of return to position before contract or fair value of services rendered, or *quantum meruit*.

The measure for value of services rendered is amount for which such services could have been purchased from one in nonbreaching party’s position at time and place services were rendered.

## Test for Unjust Enrichment
1. Plaintiff conferred benefit on defendant
2. Defendant had appreciation or knowledge of benefit
3. Defendant accepted or retained benefit under circumstances making it inequitable for defendant to retain benefit
