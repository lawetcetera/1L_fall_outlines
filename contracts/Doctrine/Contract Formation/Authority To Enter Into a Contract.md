# Authority To Enter Into a Contract 

Not all agents of a corporation can contract on its behalf. A corporation can argue that it did not enter into a contract which an agent executed on its behalf on the grounds that:
* The agent lacked express authority
	* Express authority is given by the corporation's bylaws
* The agent lacked apparent authority
	* Apparent authority is that which an outside observer can reasonably expect the agent to have
* The corporation failed to ratify the contract
	* If a corporation executes a promise even though the agent lacked the authority to enter into the contract, it ratifies (i.e., endorses) that it has entered into that contract
