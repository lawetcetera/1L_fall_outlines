# Unilateral vs. Bilateral Contracts
 
## Bilateral
A bilateral agreement is one which relies on the exchange of promises between two or more parties. 

## Unilateral
A unilateral agreement is a promise made by a single party which expects no promise in return. Generally, unilateral contracts are unenforceable for lack of [[Consideration | consideration]].
 
 The Restatement (Second) of Contracts moves towards recognition of unilateral contracts by terming them as option contracts -- "a right to finish performance which one has commenced," in order to avoid situations in which the offeror revokes his promise just before the completion of performance.
