# Acceptance
When an offer is formally "accepted" is also the source of much litigation. Acceptance may take the form of the execution of a written agreement, payment, or commencement of performance.

It is the offeror's imperative to specify what form of acceptance he expects. If the form of acceptance is left ambiguous and is the source of disagreement, it is left to the courts to interpret whether the contract was accepted.

One who learns of an offer after having commenced performance may accept that offer by completing performance, see [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts  ยง 51]]. Generally, learning of an offer after rendering full performance does not constitute an acceptance.

*The mailbox rule* holds that an acceptance is effective as soon as put out of the offeree's possession, without regard to whether it ever reaches the offeror," with the notable exception of option contracts, see [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts  ยง 63]].

## Termination of an Offer
The power of acceptance may be terminated by
* rejection
* [[Offer#Counteroffer|counteroffer]]
* lapse in time
* [[Offer#Revocation|revocation by the offeror]]
* death or incapacity of the offeror
