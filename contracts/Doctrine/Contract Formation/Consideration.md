# Consideration Generally
In general, consideration refers to a property of an agreement between individuals that each person receives something as part of the agreement. This "something" is a promise made in return that may take the form of currency, performance of a service, non-performance of an undesired action, etc.

In general, the law chooses to recognizes agreements supported by consideration as legally binding and those not supported by consideration as gratuitious. However, this rule is not without exception, as explored below.

Courts usually refrain from inquiring as to the adequacy of consideration.

Consideration must benefit the promisor. If consideration is benefit only to the promisee and detriment to the promisor, it is not valid.

## Promises to Make a Gift

A promise to make a gift usually lacks the components necessary to form an enforceable contract. Notable exceptions include when a gift is conditioned on performance or nonperformance of given behavior, see: [[Hamer v. Sidway]].

## Past Consideration

Past consideration is generally invalid because the essential understanding of consideration is that it is given in exchange for the promise of the other party.

## Moral Consideration

Generally, behavior that one is already obligated to undertake is insufficient for consideration, because it is not given in exchange for the promise of the other party.

## Illusory Promises

Promises will sometimes hinge on of flexible commitments. These often involve language such as "best effort" or "good faith" on the part of the promisee.

## Double-Dipping

Agreement by a party to render services which it is already under contract to render cannot be valid consideration in a new agreement between the same parties.

## Policy Considerations of Requiring Consideration
* Consideration evidences that a contract did indeed take place; both parties can point to something.
* Consideration requires parties to demonstrate the seriousness of ther intentions.
* Consideration provides a simple, clear test for enforceability
