# Definiteness
Contracts must be sufficiently definite in their terms. Terms that leave core provisions up to future negotiations may or may not be enforced. The future agreement is only binding once it is reached. Contracts that leave a core provision open for future calculation under a sufficiently specific formula are generally enforceable.

The public policy motivation for encouraging definite contracts is to avoid litigation over parties who "agree to agree", but then fail to actually agree.
    
## Indefiniteness and the Uniform Commercial Code
The Uniform Commercial Code allows for parties to be bound when theyâ€™ve reached an agreement in principle, even if they plan to negotiate further over specific terms, so long as part of the agreement includes sufficiently specific language as to how those terms will be reached in the future.
