# Definiteness

-   Walker v. Keith - terms of extension/renewal can be left for future determination by a prescribed method, but simply leaving terms for future decision without a specified method renders the agreement unenforceable
    

-   If an essential element is reserved for future agreement between parties, the promise gives rise to no legal obligation until that future agreement is made
    
-   Contracts are supposed to be definite so they don’t end up in courts for judges to decide the terms
    
## Indefiniteness and the Uniform Commercial Code
The Uniform Commercial Code allows for parties to be bound when they’ve reached an agreement in principle, even if they plan to negotiate further over specific terms, so long as part of the agreement includes sufficiently specific language as to how those terms will be reached in the future.
