# Form Contracts

There is a duty to read any form contract you enter into as a consumer, so the terms are generally enforceable even if the consumer failed to read them.

*Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute*
The Supreme Court held that it was unreasonable to assume that boilerplate contracts were negotiated over, but the fact that something wasn't negotiated over is an insufficient ground on which to deem the contract unenforceable. ^1cb0b4

## Terms of Service Agreements
Terms of Service Agreements are binding form contracts, but the offeror must make the contract apparent to the offeree before it is treated as binding. If the ToS is hidden from view, and a reasonable user may not notice it, then it is not binding.

*Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.*
Clicking a download button doesn’t communicate assent to contractual terms if the offer didn’t make it clear that it would. Offeree isn’t bound by contractual provisions he isn’t aware of, but only if the terms weren’t called to his attention/wouldn’t be obvious as contractual to a reasonably prudent offeree
