# Promissory Estoppel

In some cases, the law will choose to enforce a contract upon which the offeree relies when taking further actions, even if that contract would otherwise lack consideration. The [[Black Letter Law/Restatement (Second)/Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 90]] holds that the remedy granted for breach in cases of promissory estoppel "may be limited as justice requires."

The justification for promissory estoppel is to avoid substantial hardship or injustice which would result if the contract was not enforced.

## Reliance

Promissory estoppel is only available if the party claiming it can demonstrate that they relied on the promise made.

*Katz v. Danny Dare*
A contract to pay a pension was held to be enforceable because the plaintiff resigned in reliance on that promise.
* The court ruled in the opposite in other cases where it was not proven that the party retired strictly in reliance on this promise

## Requirements
1. Clear and definite promise by the promisor
2. Promise was made with the expectation that promisee will rely thereon
3. Promisee reasonably relied on the promise
4.  Promisee’s reliance on the promise resulted in detriment of a definite and substantial nature
5. Injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise


## Relief
Relief in cases of promissory estoppel is generally limited to [[Money Damages#Reliance Damages|reliance damages]], as opposed to [[Money Damages#Expectation Damages|expectation damages]]
