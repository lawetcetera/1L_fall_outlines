# Offer

The law of contracts recognizes the offeror as the master of the terms of the agreement. He may change them at any time or revoke the offer completely, provided he does so before the offeree accepts. The offeror also has the power to dictate the terms of what constitutes acceptance of his offer.

The question of when something is to be taken as an "offer" versus when it is to be taken as an invitation to bargain is the source of much litigation. This is most often clarified through context, such as the existence of prior bargaining or industry customs.

## Offers made in jest
In [[Lucy v. Zehmer]], the court held that an offer made in jest but taken seriously by the offeree is enforceable.

## Revocation
An offeror may revoke his offer at any point in time prior to the acceptance of that offer.

An offeror who fails to revoke his offer before it is accepted is bound to the contract created, unless (in the case of non-fungible commodities such as property), the accepting pary has knowledge that the offer has been accepted by another party.

An offeror who enters into an option contract with another party is bound to keep his offer open until it expires. Option contracts, however, require valid consideration to be enforceable.

## Counteroffer
Counteroffers are generally held to be a rejection of the initial offer and the posing of a new offer. The legal implications of that are the voiding of the initial offer. The party that tenders a counteroffer has no legal right to go on to accept the initial offer, and the the party who receives the counteroffer has no legal obligation to respond to it. This logic invokes the "mirror image rule", that an acceptance must mirror an offer.

## Invitations to Bargain
Advertisements and price-quotations are generally held under the common law to be invitations to enter into negotiations rather than offers.

In the case of advertisements, the purchaser makes an offer by tendering currency, and the advertiser accepts that offer by supplying the advertised item. The case of price-quotations follows the same logic. The legal consequence of this is that advertisers and those who quote a price are not legally bound to enter into a contract with the purchasor until they accept the purchasor's offer.
